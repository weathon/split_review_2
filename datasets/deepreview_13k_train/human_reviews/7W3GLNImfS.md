## Abstract
Human feedback has become the de facto standard for evaluating the performance of Large Language Models, and is increasingly being used as a training objective. However, it is not clear which properties of a generated output this single `preference' score captures. We hypothesise that preference scores are subjective and open to undesirable biases. We critically analyse the use of human feedback for both training and evaluation, to verify whether it fully captures a range of crucial error criteria. We find that while preference scores have fairly good coverage, they under-represent important aspects like factuality. We further hypothesise that both preference scores and error annotation may be affected by confounders, and leverage instruction-tuned models to generate outputs that vary along two possible confounding dimensions: assertiveness and complexity. We find that the assertiveness of an output skews the perceived rate of factuality errors, indicating that human annotations are not a fully reliable evaluation metric or training objective. Finally, we offer preliminary evidence that using human feedback as a training objective disproportionately increases the assertiveness of model outputs. We encourage future work to carefully consider whether preference scores are well aligned with the desired objective.

### Summary
This paper studies an important topic that is very prevalent these days in the LLM field especially (but generally as well)  - use of human feedback to evaluate large language models as well as use the coarse grained data of human preference to train/tune the LLMs - the work studies, defines, disentangles and subjectivity of the human preferences and tries to ‘explain’ how various types of errors are correlated to this preference. It further suggests that human preferences do not correlate well to the important dimension of factuality of the LLM generated information.  

In particular, the paper tries to define a broad set of discrete dimensions of various properties/attributes of fine-grained evaluation criteria for LLM model for human judgment - this is trying to map the one preference score to the underlying error categories that the one score should ideally represent (somewhat equally in principle) - however these categories are meant to be defined to capture the epistemological meaning of the human preference and map that to a simple oenology of the error types described in the paper. 

The paper then uses 3 datasets and collects the human preference annotations (with quality control and best practices) )on the various recent model outputs and the ontological error types. The  paper uses a Lasso regression model to fit the preference score to error categories for studying how various error categories contribute to the overall mapping to the single human preference. Some error types have a stronger contribution to the mapping function (eg. Refusal to answer which is very objective dimension unlike others) which some other do not contribute (eg. Harmfulness). Some other important dimensions like factuality and inconsistency have less weights compared to the others. 

The paper then tries to study the ‘halo effect’ cognitive bias of the LLM generated output and how humans perceive and prefer more assertive generation and more complex generation over less assertiveness and less complexity. The paper notes that increased assertiveness and complexity both lead to slightly higher perceived quality, while low assertiveness
leads to the worst rated responses. respond. Authors also note that non-expert annotators tend to underestimate the rate of inconsistency or factuality errors, and they are less likely to spot these errors in outputs that are assertive. The authors suggest how controlling the prompts for assertiveness (eg. having low assertiveness) could perhaps be used to promote safer refusals.

Since perceived preference is correlated with assertiveness, the relationship suggests that using human feedback as a training objective could inadvertently increase the complexity and assertiveness of outputs (as a side-effect) and thus introduce these biases in the trained models.

### Strengths
- RLHF and human preference alignment topic for LLM human-AI alignment is one of the highly discussed topics today for chatbot training. RLHF is used to teach the models to generate safer outputs (for example, refuse to respond when inappropriate, promote politeness and reduce toxicity and biases). The studies in the paper suggest that the human preferences can easily get confounded with assertive and complex text and prefer those therefore introduce this 'assertiveness bias' and 'complexity bias' in the modeling process. 

- The paper also discusses important findings around factuality (and the important topic of hallucinations studies in LLMs). "Crowdworkers underestimate the rate of factuality and inconsistency errors. This difference is increased for high assertiveness responses, and decreased
for low assertiveness responses. In other words, annotators are more trusting of assertive responses, and are less likely to identify factuality or inconsistency errors within them" -> in other works it could be possible that RLHF methods may promote hallucinations, and introduce more assertiveness and complexity in the generated output.

### Weaknesses
 - it is not clear if this error type categorization is comprehensive enough; authors haven't provided any empirical/experimental support for these error categories.
- There are other important biases from AI safety perspective that isn't explicitly studied in the paper (could possibly make the paper more relevant) - hallucinations, more fine-grained categorization of inconsistencies, toxicity, etc 
- the datasets studied may not be comprehensive enough to have captured some of the important dimensions of AI safety (toxicity, attribution, etc) 
- Besides the Lasso regression model, other interpretable/explainable ML methods might have shed more light on error categories and their correlation with both human preference and model output. 
- authors note that human preferences are mostly absolute or relative - there isn't any comparison between the two in this research. Since the paper provides insights into understanding these human preferences, more focus on various types of human preferences would have strengthened the finding of the paper
- Authors very briefly touch upon the AI safety implications but do not give justice to this very important piece of information in the paper - what are the AI safety implications as a result of using human preferences for training and evaluation.

### Summary
This paper analyzes potential confounding factors in human judgment of LLM-generated text, and hypothesizes that these confounders lead to optimizing the wrong metrics in RLHF (i.e., optimizing for assertiveness rather than factuality). The main result is that they find human annotators rely on features such as assertiveness and complexity when judging the overall quality of a piece of text, rather than relying on harder-to-evaluate features like factuality. The paper also evaluates quality judgments for existing models trained with RLHF on human preferences, again finding a correlation between assertiveness and quality judgments.

### Strengths
This paper studies a very important problem: that without understanding the underlying factors influencing human judgments of text, in light of ambiguous and underspecified annotation guidelines asking for nebulous quality ratings, when performing standard RLHF we are optimizing models in unintentional directions. The analysis of annotations is relatively thorough and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
A couple of points:
* I wish there were discussion on not just the problem of individual judgments being ambiguous, but that standard RLHF is optimizing towards a single user preference per example rather than considering factors resulting in a distribution over judgments for a number of different annotators (a point that is made e.g., as a motivation for jury learning, Gordon et al. 2022).
* I would also like more discussion on what to do in light of these findings. There were hints at one possible perspective of a solution -- optimizing nebulous "preference" is far from what people do when using language, which is more based on utility and communicative success (which preference is not tied to at all).
* I think the analysis in Section 4 is conflating a few different factors in comparing models -- the fact that Command is trained off-policy and Llama 2 is on-policy isn't discussed in enough depth for me to be convinced this is relevant to mention. I don't have a good intuition on why that might influence the model behavior, especially if the two models are trained on different data as well. The distinction between on vs. off-policy and RLHF vs. non-RLHF is not very precise. There are a couple elements here: whether we are using human judgments for training in any way, whether we're training a reward model and performing online RL with it. One could perform online RL to train/finetune an LM without any human feedback (e.g., reward models being BLEU scores), and one could train with human feedback without on-policy learning (essentially imitation learning with loss coefficients derived from human feedback). Or the other combinations: RL with a reward model trained on human feedback, standard imitation learning without human feedback (i.e. the standard language modeling objective).
* Following the above, I would have liked to see an experiment that directly shows how optimizing for human preference influences outputs across different dimensions explored in this paper (e.g, assertivness). The evidence from this paper is post-hoc analysis of existing models (in Section 4), and the earlier experiments showing annotators generally conflate quality with features like assertiveness/complexity. There are a couple of things this analysis conflates itself, e.g., the actual data that Command and Llama 2 are trained on, and their learning algorithms. But an even stronger experiment would perform RLHF-based finetuning (or some kind of finetuning with human preference judgments) on data where we have judgments of or could control complexity and assertiveness, and measure how the final models perform on factuality judgments after this process. E.g., perhaps this would show that optimizing for assertiveness++ responses hurts factuality. Or maybe it would show that with the exact same data, fine-tuning using a reward model exacerbates this problem more than just fine-tuning directly. But with the current analysis presented, it's hard to make any concrete conclusion beyond that all these models result in judgments conflating quality with style.
* I would also like to see an experiment controlling for factuality, like in Section 3.2. E.g., if it's possible to even post-hoc separate the results in Figs 3 and 4 by whether an expert judged the output as factual or not. Basically, do you find that assertive false responses are rated as factual by annotators more often than inassertive true responses?
* I think the main table showing expert judgments for Sec 3.2 is in the appendix, but in my opinion it should be in the main paper.

### Questions
* Why were the error types in Section 2 the ones chosen? There is a brief discussion (inspiration from Xu et al. 2023, Gricean maxims) but it would be nice to have more discussion on why these particular types were chosen.
* Why do contradiction/scope/fluency/harmful have no contribution in Figure 1?
* Did you analyze where disagreements came from in factuality judgments in Section 2.1? Where agreement was 0.64
* What was the hypothesis of assertiveness and complexity being confounders founded upon? Are there other confounding factors that could influence this, e.g., length?
* "incorrectly perceived as being less repetitive" -- is repetitiveness objective? It seems a lot more subjective than something like factuality.
* What are the two lines in Figure 6?
* Figure 5 shows annotated error rates -- are these expert annotations or general crowdsourced annotations?

### Summary
This paper studies what attributes human preferences models over LLM output stend to capture, and which they don’t. Specifically, it considers ten error types: harmfulness, fluency, scope, repetition, refusal, formatting, relevance, factuality, inconsistency, and contradiction, and has human annotators label whether a failure arises in any of these categories, then uses lasso on top of these categories to to predict the annotated quality of an output (measured by different annotators). They find that refusal, formatting, relevance, repetition, and factuality, and inconsistency lead to reductions in overall score, while contradictions, scope, fluency, and harmfulness do not. In a second experiment, the annotators find that low assertiveness tends to lower annotator scores, and raising assertiveness tends to improve scores across subcategories (e.g., factuality, relevance). The paper finally finds that RLHF increases assertiveness, suggesting that the annotator preferences get baked into the objective.

### Strengths
* The paper studies an important problem: what attributes do human labelers actually care about in model outputs, and does this match the attributes we'd like
* The paper writing is clear throughout and easy to follow
* Many of the empirical results would likely be interesting to the community at large; I especially liked Figure 5, which shows that simply increasing assertiveness reduces the error rates for many categories (e.g., factuality)

### Weaknesses
 * The paper feels a bit ad-hoc; the properties tested seemed kind of arbitrarily chosen, but the specific set tested should have a significant impact on the learned lasso weights (e.g., if one feature is more predictive than the rest, the lasso weight would put all of it on that)
* Some aspects of the paper do not engage with prior work. For example, it claims that “human feedback the de facto standard for evaluation” with no citation, and does not engage with the extensive work benchmarking LLMs 
* The RLHF increases assertiveness claim is tested indirectly; it compares Llama 2 13B and Command 52B, which have many confounders beyond RLHF.

### Questions
* How do the lasso weights change when you optimize on different subsets of the properties?
* How much does the choice of ten properties you label for matter? What would happen if you included different properties?

### Summary
The paper is a careful study of biases in human feedback, a critical component of influential approaches to aligning (e.g. RLHF) and evaluating LMs. The authors conduct extensive experiments having humans evaluate responses of several LMs (Cohere models, Mosaic models and LLaMA-2).

First, the authors (i) ask crowdworkers to evaluate LMs’ outputs according to a set of separate criteria as well as give overall score, (ii) train a linear model to predict overall score from scores for separate criteria, (iii) use coefficients of the linear model as a measure of importance of each separate criterion. Model refusing to response is the most important criterion. When the crowdworkers are shown distractor samples (query and response are mismatched), factuality and contradiction (within the output) are both rated worse which implies that annotators fail to disentangle these criteria from the overall quality of a response.

Next, the authors investigate how assertiveness and complexity of LM response affect human judgements. They found that annotators are more trusting of assertive responses, and are less likely to identify factuality or inconsistency errors within them. Furthermore, more complex or more assertive responses are incorrectly perceived as being less repetitive.

Both of these findings are cast a shadow of doubt on whether reward derived from human feedback is the right optimization target for aligning LMs or the right criterion for evaluating them.

### Strengths
1. I think the paper addresses a very important and understudied problem, at the very heart of AI safety: how to supervise and evaluated highly capable LMs. The fact that humans are easily misled and prefer convincing-and-assertive-but-subtly-wrong replies over truly correct replies is extremely worrying as it suggests we are training LMs to be deceptive.
2. The paper is well-written and easy to follow. 
3. The analyses in the paper are carefully designed and comprehensive. I appreciate that the authors took care of estimating crowdworkers reliability, that their human feedback collection procedure is informed by a body of NLP and linguistics and that they conduct experiments with relatively large models (13B-52B).

### Weaknesses
1. One big question not addressed in the paper is how the biases in human judgement scale with human capabilities (e.g. question difficulty, annotator competence) and model capabilities (e.g. model size). Are humans more biased when evaluating responses they’re less competent to evaluate (e.g. medical advice, science explanations)? Are larger models more susceptible to exploit human biases? Overall, I think a good perspective for grounding this paper is scalable oversight [1]: the problem of evaluating agents more capable than the evaluators. LM capabilities will soon surpass human capabilities on many tasks and it’s critical to know whether human feedback will be increasingly misleading. That’s of course a big open problem and I don’t take not addressing it against the paper, it but it would be relatively easy to do experiments with models of the same family but different size or group questions by (perceived) difficulty.
2. I’m not sure I’m convinced that “Human evaluation is necessary” (as stated in the conclusion). Techniques such as RL from AI feedback have been shown to be as effective as RLHF for increasing the harmlessness of LMs [2]. They ultimately rely on humans, but these are human experts involved in prompt engineering and designing rules and constitutions used for generating training data for SFT and training preference models. A big open questions is whether LMs-as-evaluators inherit human biases, even when carefully prompted. A simple experiment addressing this question would involve having an LM play the role of an evaluator and conducting a similar analysis for its judgements.
3. The crowdworkes were asked to rate LM responses according to each criterion in series and then to give an overall score. I wonder such ordering of the task is not itself a confounder. Would overall scores be different if the crowsworkers were not asked to give scores for criteria before? Would a score for `Formatting` be different if the crowdworkers were not ask for `Factuality` before? Do authors control for this anyhow?
4. It’s subtly incorrect to say that “Perez et al. (2023) identified similar ‘inverse-scaling’ behaviour, where training on a RLHF objective worsens sycophancy”. I think the paper showed that base LMs are already pretty sycophantic and that RLHF does not fix that. I think from that paper alone it’s still unclear that RLHF increases sycophancy; there is no robust trend. However, Sharma et al. [3] have recently provided much stronger evidence for the role of human feedback and RLHF objective in the emergence of sycophancy.

### Questions
This is not really a flaw, but it would be much better if the experiments were done on responses from frontier models (such as GPT-4, Claude 2 and possibly LLaMA-2-70B). Was budget the limiting factor?

A minor remark: The idea of predicting human preference judgements using a logistic regression model on top of human-interpretable features was recently explored in two concurrent papers that might be worth taking a look at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13548 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13011
