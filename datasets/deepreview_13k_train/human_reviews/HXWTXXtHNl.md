- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Conditional diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in various generative tasks, but training them requires large-scale datasets that often contain noise in conditional inputs, a.k.a. noisy labels. This noise leads to condition mismatch and quality degradation of generated data. This paper proposes Transition-aware weighted Denoising Score Matching (TDSM) for training conditional diffusion models with noisy labels, which is the first study in the line of diffusion models. The TDSM objective contains a weighted sum of score networks, incorporating instance-wise and time-dependent label transition probabilities. We introduce a transition-aware weight estimator, which leverages a time-dependent noisy-label classifier distinctively customized to the diffusion process. Through experiments across various datasets and noisy label settings, TDSM improves the quality of generated samples aligned with given conditions. Furthermore, our method improves generation performance even on prevalent benchmark datasets, which implies the potential noisy labels and their risk of generative model learning. Finally, we show the improved performance of TDSM on top of conventional noisy label corrections, which empirically proving its contribution as a part of label-noise robust generative models.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new label-noise robust method for training conditional diffusion models. This is achieved by making use of an estimated transition relation from noisy labels to clean labels. Some theoretical analyses have also been proposed under the class-dependent label-noise setting. Experiments across various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. **Targeting an Important Problem:** The paper aims to handle noisy labels in large-scale datasets used for training diffusion models. Addressing this problem is crucial as it is a common and practical challenge in the deployment of these models in real-world scenarios.
2. **A New Approach to Noisy Labels in Diffusion Models:** The paper introduces a new methodology to address noisy labels in conditional diffusion models, a topic not extensively covered in existing literature.
3. **Clarity and Accessibility:** The introduction and overall presentation of the paper are clear and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. **Missing Citations:** The paper could be significantly enhanced by including additional relevant literature. Learning the transition relation from noisy labels to clean labels has been previously explored under the umbrella of mixture proportion estimation. Specifically, methods such as those based on the method of moments or expectation-maximization for estimating mixing proportions in latent variable models are highly relevant. Furthermore, methods for estimating the transition matrix in class-dependent settings, particularly those that leverage anchor points or specific structural assumptions about the noise process, are also very related. Acknowledging these popular works could provide a richer theoretical foundation and contextualize the novelty of the proposed approach.

2. **Missing Baselines:** There are many methods for learning with noisy labels. It would be beneficial to combine existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for learning with noisy labels to obtain estimated clean labels. For example, methods that explicitly model the noise transition matrix or employ techniques like sample reweighting or label correction could be used. Then, utilizing conditional diffusion models on these cleaned labels and comparing the performance with the author's method could offer a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method’s efficacy compared to current alternatives. This would help to isolate the specific contribution of the proposed method from the benefits of general noisy label techniques.

3. **Unclear Advantage:** There is a need for a more detailed explanation regarding the advantage of the proposed method over existing methods, especially in recovering clean labels. Since the performance of diffusion models in noisy label scenarios hinges significantly on the accuracy of label recovery, explaining how the method enhances this aspect compared to others would greatly benefit readers in understanding the true potential and innovation of your approach. It is unclear if the method's strength lies in better label recovery or in some other aspect of the diffusion model training process.

4. **Limited Application:** The focus on class-dependent noise settings might limit the broader applicability of the proposed method. The assumption of class-dependent noise, where the probability of a label flip depends only on the true class, could be strong and not verifiable in practical scenarios. Real-world noise is often instance-dependent, where the noise is affected by the specific characteristics of each data point. It would be insightful if the paper could discuss the potential implications and limitations of this assumption, including how it might affect the generalizability of the proposed method to other noise settings or real-world applications where such assumptions may not be easily verified. For example, how would the method perform if the noise is correlated with the input features?

### Questions
1. Could the authors elaborate on how their method of learning the transition relation from noisy labels to clean labels differs from or aligns with the existing literature in mixture proportion estimation?
2. Could the authors provide further details on how their method more effectively recovers clean labels compared to existing state-of-the-art methods VolMinNet (ICML 21), InstanceGM (WACV23), and DivideMix (ICLR20)?
3. Would the authors consider adding additional experiments to demonstrate the performance when combining the existing state-of-the-art methods for learning with noisy labels with a conditional diffusion model? Additionally, could they compare the accuracy of clean label recovery with these methods?
4. Could the authors explain which specific mechanisms or features in their approach contribute to improved label recovery?
5. How do the authors verify the presence of class-dependent noise in practical applications?

### Summary
This paper highlights the challenges associated with training on extensive datasets, which often contain noise in their condition to make noisy labels. Such noise introduces the risk of condition mismatches, which can degrade the quality of the generated data. To tackle this issue, the paper presents the Transition-aware weighted Denoising Score Matching (TDSM) method. This approach is specifically designed to robustly train conditional diffusion models with noisy labels.

The TDSM framework incorporates a label-transition weight for the score networks. These weights are derived from the relationship between conditional scores for both noisy and genuine labels, and can be estimated with a pre-trained noisy-classifier. Empirical evaluations, on multiple datasets and a range of noisy label configurations, demonstrate the efficiency of the TDSM approach.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and polished, facilitating a smooth reading experience. The mathematical presentations are articulated clearly and the theoretical results are complete and sound. Additionally, the inclusion of model overviews and illustrative figures for the components simplifies the understanding of the proposed method. 

- The experimental results well validate the approach. Notably, the paper comprehensively study both the effects of the conditional models and the impact of conditional generation with label guidance. Comprehensive results are provided in both the main paper and supplementary material.

- The practical side of the research is solid. The authors have been very detailed in their implementation and provided their experiment code, which ensures reproducibility.

### Weaknesses
 - Given that the estimation of the transition-aware weight relies on a noisy-classifier, it would be advantageous for the authors to present studies evaluating how the performance of the noisy-classifier, specifically its accuracy and calibration, affects the model's overall performance. It is crucial to understand how errors in the noisy-classifier propagate to the diffusion model and whether overconfidence in the noisy classifier leads to a degradation in the quality of the generated samples.

- In Table 2, the authors seem to only compare with DSM with non-class-aware evaluation metrics. What's the reason for this comparison with the specific metrics? It would be more informative to include class-aware metrics to assess the quality of the generated samples within each class, which is particularly relevant for conditional generation tasks.

- On "clean" datasets, TDSM demonstrates notably superior performance, suggesting the potential presence of noisy labels. It would be insightful to know the threshold or proportion of noisy labels at which a significant performance difference emerges between DSM and TDSM. Furthermore, if the datasets used to train the noisy-classifier (for estimating class transitions) contain noisy labels, would this introduce additional inaccuracies in label correction? It would be beneficial for the authors to conduct a thorough analysis of these concerns, including how the performance of the noisy classifier degrades with increasing noise in the training data, and how this degradation impacts the final generation quality.

- In the review of diffusion models, the authors seem to only review from the score matching networks, while omit the diffusion models derivated from optmizing the ELBO. This omission limits the scope of the review and does not provide a complete picture of the landscape of diffusion models.


- Previous works are not correctly reviewed or cited. For example, the reference of denoising diffusion probabilistic model (Ho et al., 2020) is classified into video generation, in the introduction, while this is a fundamental work in diffusion models, and the authors may wanted to put video diffusion models (Ho et al., 2022) there. Moreover, some prior works that tackle the uncurated label distributions are not discussed and compared in the paper. Specifically, methods that address class imbalance or label noise in GANs [1,2] and diffusion models [3] should be discussed and compared to highlight the novelty of the proposed approach.

- It would be beneficial to include a color bar in Fig 8 to interprete the meaning of the colors presented.
