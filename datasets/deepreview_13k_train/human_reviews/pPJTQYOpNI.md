# Imitation Learning from Observation with Automatic Discount Scheduling

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 8, 5, 8

## Abstract
Humans often acquire new skills through observation and imitation.
For robotic agents, learning from the plethora of unlabeled video demonstration data available on the Internet necessitates imitating the expert without access to its action, presenting a challenge known as Imitation Learning from Observation (ILfO).
A common approach to tackle ILfO problems is to convert them into inverse reinforcement learning problems, utilizing a proxy reward computed from the agent's and the expert's observations.
Nonetheless, we identify that tasks characterized by a \textit{progress dependency} property pose significant challenges for such approaches; in these tasks, the agent needs to initially learn the expert's preceding behaviors before mastering the subsequent ones.
Our investigation reveals that the main cause is that the reward signals assigned to later steps hinder the learning of initial behaviors.
To address this challenge, we present a novel ILfO framework that enables the agent to master earlier behaviors before advancing to later ones.
We introduce an \textit{Automatic Discount Scheduling} (ADS) mechanism that adaptively alters the discount factor in reinforcement learning during the training phase, prioritizing earlier rewards initially and gradually engaging later rewards only when the earlier behaviors have been mastered.
Our experiments, conducted on nine Meta-World tasks, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all tasks, including those that are unsolvable by them.

### Summary
This paper proposes ADS, an imitation-learning-from-observation method that equips proxy-based reward with automatic discount scheduling. The core idea is to put a scheduler on the discount factor of the environment as the policy progresses to follow the expert demonstrations. Experiments show that the proposed method beat the selected baselines.

### Post-rebuttal
Thanks for the response to my questions and for running the additional experiments. The additional experiments addressed my concerns regarding the truncation baseline, as well as comparison with other curriculum learning approach. However, I would like to maintain my score for the following reason. While I agree with the authors that it is harder to find a discount scheduler in generic RL settings compared to ILfO, RL practitioners have been trying gradually increasing the discount factor as a way to stabilize policy learning, for example, by simply looking at how episode returns are converging. Since the authors decided to formalize such a method, which I believe is good for the community -- it only makes sense to include a formal/theoretical analysis, as discount factor is such a fundamental component of any RL setting. Without it, the paper seems incomplete, in my personal opinion.

### Strengths
+ The presented idea is simple and well motivated.
+ Strong empirical performance compared to selected baselines.

### Weaknesses
 - While the presented idea is simple and interesting, it demands further analysis:
  - If the goal is to first learn to follow earlier parts of trajectories first, and then move forward once policy learns, why not simply put a scheduler on truncating the expert trajectories, instead of on the discount factor? Changing the discount factor seems unnatural, especially considering that it is used together with an off-policy RL algorithm. As soon as one changes the discount factor, the target Q value for all data stored in the replay buffer changes even if one does not update the target Q network. This introduces a non-stationarity in the learning process that is not well addressed. The authors should provide a more detailed analysis on how this non-stationarity affects the convergence of the algorithm, especially when using an off-policy algorithm like SAC which is known to be sensitive to target changes.
- The main comparison in figure 3 does not seem fair: the baselines should be other curriculum learning approaches instead of vanilla proxy-reward approaches. The current comparison only shows that the proposed method is better than methods that do not use curriculum learning, which is not a strong claim. The authors should compare against existing curriculum learning methods for imitation learning to demonstrate the advantage of their method.
- Scheduling the discount factor is not unique to ILfO but is generic to all RL problems. Can the authors provide more analysis on its implications in the generic RL setting? For example, how should we expect the convergence properties to change when we perform a discount factor scheduling. The authors should at least discuss the potential challenges and benefits of applying this method to general RL problems, even if they do not provide experimental results.

### Questions
My main question:

- Why schedule the discount factor instead of expert demonstration (truncate) length
- Implications on the RL setting when changing the discount factor

Also, I am curious to know the exact formulations of the cost functions used in the OT methods in the paper.

Please see above in the weaknesses section for details.

### Summary
This paper works towards the common difficulty of learning earlier behaviours in ILfO imitation learning tasks, which is due to the property of progress dependencies of ILfO. To encourage the agent to master earlier parts of demonstration before proceeding to subsequent ones, the authors propose a mechanism called Automatic Discount Scheduling (ADS). Experiments prove the idea works and brings great gain compared with SOTA approaches.

### Strengths
1. As demonstrated by the paper, the problem of progress dependencies is a critical obstacle for effective ILfO learning. Several persuasive examples provided by paper illustrates this point. The proposed solution seizes a key part of the cause of this issue and posit a well-designed learning technique - ADS to avoid it. The demonstration is quite clear and algorithm design is intuitive and reasonable.
2. Experiments are comprehensive with sufficient performance gain. Ablation study is abundant. Details are provided for possible reproduction of the results.

### Weaknesses
1. I'm quite curious about the motivation of this paper: it is clear by reading the introduction part to know that proxy reward based ILfO is susceptible to such progress dependency issue. However, the problem seems to be similar to a common issue for reinforcement learning which is called the catastrophic forgetting problem. Also classic methods like Q-learning already involves a replay buffer to avoid the possibility of being stuck by a local optimality, or the so-called instability problem of RL training. It would be more convincing to discuss the relationship between these issues and the one solved by this work.
2. If a model-based planning is employed, will it also alleviate ILfO's problem? How does it compare with the ADS as proposed?

### Questions
1. How's the progress dependeny issue related to RL difficulty like instability or catastrophic forgetting?
2. If a model-based planning is employed, will it also alleviate ILfO's problem? How does it compare with the ADS as proposed?

### Summary
The paper delves into the challenge of Imitation Learning from Observations (ILfO) for robotic agents, where they must learn from unlabeled video demonstrations without knowing the expert's actions. While many convert ILfO problems into Inverse Reinforcement Learning (RL) issues using proxy rewards, the paper identifies a limitation: tasks with a "progress dependency" property. In such tasks, agents must first grasp the expert's earlier behaviors before mastering subsequent ones. The study finds that reward signals for later steps impede learning initial behaviors. To overcome this, the authors introduce a new ILfO framework with an Automatic Discount Scheduling (ADS) mechanism. This mechanism adaptively adjusts the RL discount factor during training, emphasizing early rewards and gradually incorporating later rewards once initial behaviors are learned. Tests on nine Meta-World tasks show this method surpasses existing techniques, even solving tasks previously deemed unsolvable.

### Strengths
The research stands out in its originality by identifying a previously unaddressed challenge in conventional ILfO algorithms, specifically their limitations in handling tasks with progress dependency. Moreover, the introduction of the Automatic Discount Scheduling (ADS) mechanism within the ILfO framework is a novel contribution, showcasing a creative combination of existing ideas to address a new problem.

The quality of the research is evident in its thorough approach to problem-solving. The authors not only diagnose the issue with current ILfO algorithms but also provide a robust solution in the form of the ADS mechanism. Their method's ability to outperform state-of-the-art ILfO methods in all nine Meta-World tasks further attests to its quality.

The paper clearly articulates the challenges faced by conventional ILfO algorithms, the intricacies of tasks characterized by progress dependency, and the proposed solution. The introduction of the ADS mechanism and its role in prioritizing earlier behaviors for agents is presented with lucidity.

The significance of the paper is twofold. First, it sheds light on a critical limitation in existing ILfO algorithms, broadening the understanding of the domain. Second, by introducing a solution that not only addresses this limitation but also excels in tasks previously deemed unsolvable, the research holds substantial importance for the advancement of robotic imitation learning.

### Weaknesses
At its heart, the paper's key proposition seems intuitive. Given that the objective is to imitate a sequence of actions, it's somewhat expected that there should be a dependency between actions. The current approach might be seen as a direct response to an oversight in the original problem formulation. Exploring more sophisticated reward designs or distance measurements could potentially offer a more nuanced solution to the challenge.

### Questions
Although the experiments show significant improvement over the selected models, I'm interested in the following comparisons.
1. A straightforward strategy to address the challenge of imitating sequences would be to divide the sequence into temporal slices and then imitate each slice in order. The absence of this seemingly obvious method in the comparative analysis is a missed opportunity. Including this approach in the experiments would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed ADS mechanism, especially when benchmarked against such a basic strategy.
2. How does the model compare with RL learning with a goal-based reward?

### Summary
This work introduces "Automatic Discount Scheduling", a mechanism to alter the discount factor during RL training. It is argued that it is helpful to alter the discount factor in order to incentivize an agent to learn early behaviors before later ones, in cases where the reward signal is a proxy reward computed based on the agent's observations in comparison to expert demonstrations. An example of such a proxy reward is optimal transport (OT) between the expert's and agent's observations. Positive results are shown on 9 Meta-World environments (e.g., comparing OT to OT + Automatic Discount Scheduling).

### Strengths
- This paper presents a heuristic method for discount scheduling that helps overcome issues when doing imitation learning through proxy rewards on tasks that have "progress dependencies". While simple, the method seems to be novel and effective.
- Results are presented on 9 tasks of various complexity in the Meta-World benchmark.
- Ablations show comparisons of ADS to fixed discount factors and exponential discount scheduling, motivating the desire for adaptive scheduling.
- The paper is well-written and presented clearly.

### Weaknesses
 - I think the paper could state more precisely what the problem being addressed is. I appreciate the motivating example of the Basketball task in Meta-World, wherein the agent learns to grasp the ball successfully but then sweeps it away before moving towards the hoop. Does the problem lie in (1) using any "traditional proxy-reward-based method," (2) using optimal transport specifically as the reward function, (3) using optimal transport with a visual encoder that does not capture task details well, and/or (4) using optimal transport over partial observations (where the partial observations are not sufficient to deduce task progress)? My feeling is that (3) is the main reason for the described behavior in the Basketball task, but the paper seems to imply that the problem is with (1), i.e., proxy reward methods in general. I think some additional clarification on this point would be valuable.
- Related to to the above point, is the motivating example mitigated if one uses a visual encoder that is more specific to the task instead of a frozen pre-trained ResNet -- so that the similarity function induced by the visual encoder better captures task progress? It appears that (part of) the underlying problem is that there is high visual similarity in the end frames (e.g. the visual embedding is focusing on the robot in the frame and not the basketball). Would fine-tuning your visual encoder to the demonstration (as in [1]) help address this problem?
- What is the motivation for using longest increasing subsequence a heuristic for progress alignment? As mentioned in the paper, this seems to correspond to "macroscopic progress." What are the advantages to LIS over OT for the progress recognizer; and if LIS is good at measuring task progress, can we just use it for the reward function instead of OT?

### Questions
Please see Weaknesses section above. I have also included some minor additional questions here:

- Have the authors experimented with using a simple curriculum learning approach? For example, e.g. Maximize OT with the first 25% of the demonstration, then the first 50%, then the first 75%, then 100% of the demonstration. How well would this perform compared to the proposed approach?
- Have the authors experimented with other cost functions in the OT formulation (e.g. a different visual encoder), and do the positive effects of ADS still hold?
