# Curriculum metric learning for robust image retrieval

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 6, 3

## Abstract
Deep Metric Learning (DML) is a widely used paradigm for learning data representations used for retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve a set of items that are relevant to a query sample. Similar to other deep learning approaches, DML is vulnerable to various forms of adversarial ranking attacks, which change the retrieval ranking through adversarial perturbations. Current DML defenses initialize their models with pretrained ImageNet weights (as is standard), though we hypothesize this is sub-optimal. Deep models optimized to solve the robust optimization framework are trained to be invariant to a set of perturbations $\Delta$, which we hypothesize is a useful, if not necessary, starting point for robust retrieval. Learning approaches for robust retrieval representations must accomplish two goals: (a) learn semantically meaningful representations, and (b) learn robust representations resistant to ranking attacks. We propose the use of curriculum learning for robust retrieval by decomposing the learning process into two steps: (1) learn robust features followed by (2) robust metric learning to learn semantic features for accurate retrieval. In this work, we demonstrate that imposing robust optimization as a feature prior is critical for learning robust retrieval representations. We show that robust representations learned by robust models possess a certain degree of robustness against ranking attacks. Furthermore, by initialing adversarial ranking defenses with robust weights, we significantly improve model's recall on benign examples and their robustness against adversarial ranking attacks

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper proposes a robust image retrieval method, which utilizes curriculum learning to design a two-stage training strategy. The designed specific training strategy aims to force the model to learn robust and semantic features simultaneously.

### Strengths
1. The problem is interesting and important.  

2. The experiments are well-structured and prove its efficiency.

### Weaknesses
1. The theoretical analysis of the proposed method is lacking.

2. The key ideas of the paper are not well presented and also make the novelty not clear enough.

### Questions
Q1: The main concern is the lack of theoretical analysis of the proposed method in the paper. The authors have given several hypotheses and abundant empirical experimental results. However, some necessary theoretical analysis is missing.

Q2: What is the meaning of beta in Formula 2? Authors should give clear descriptions of these formulas.

Q3: In Figure 4, why does the random triplet sampling strategy achieve better performance than EST and ACT? More theoretical analysis should be given.

Q4: Please give more details about the mentioned curriculum learning strategy in the paper.

### Summary
This paper proposes a curriculum learning method to learn robust features for image retrieval tasks. In particular, a two-stage learning scheme consisting of robust feature learning and robust metric learning is proposed to make the learned features semantic meaningful, and ranking attacks resistant. The experiments conducted on several benchmark dataset for image retrieval have verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The idea of addressing the adversarial attack issue along with the curriculum learning direction is interesting and inspiring. 
2. This paper provides the readers with a lot of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and the properties of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper makes the readers hard to follow due to the following reasons: a) most of the figures and tables are not clear due to a lack of description of notations. For example in Figure 2, what are EST, ACT, and HM? What does the term ERS represent? In addition, in Table 1, what are CA+, CA-, QA+, QA-, etc? b) this paper contains several typos and grammar issues. These above parts make the readers confused and easily get lost.

2. This paper needs more theoretical analysis of the proposed learning method to better support the argument of this work, not simply empirical results. Moreover, a comparison between the proposed method and some existing curriculum learning related methods could be made to better demonstrate the efficacy of this work. 

3. As to the related work part, more curriculum learning related work in the robust feature learning area might be added to better locate the position of this work.

### Summary
Not familiar with the area. Please ignore my score.

### Strengths
Not familiar with the area. Please ignore my score.

### Weaknesses
Weaknesses:

Lack of novelty: The paper's main finding, that using adversarial trained models to initialize retrieval models improves their robustness against adversarial ranking attacks, is not surprising. Adversarial training has been widely studied and shown to enhance robustness in various downstream applications. Therefore, this finding cannot be considered as novel. If there are any novel aspects, they might lie in the quantitative experiments conducted on the improvement in retrieval tasks.

Ambiguity in the concept of curriculum learning: The paper claims to propose a CURRICULUM METRIC LEARNING method, but it is observed that there is a lack of direct connection between the pre-training task and the subsequent adversarial training task in retrieval. Additionally, the authors have not provided any contributions related to the curriculum. As a result, it is challenging to perceive the proposed method as a CURRICULUM METRIC LEARNING approach.

Insufficient analysis of experimental conclusions: Although the experimental results demonstrate performance improvement, there is a lack of in-depth analysis. The authors could further explore the reasons behind the improvement and explain why specific adversarial training initialization methods are more effective in enhancing the robustness of retrieval models. Such analysis would strengthen the credibility of the experimental conclusions.

### Summary
This paper investigates the robustness of deep metric learning models to adversarial ranking attacks. The authors first show that even simply initializing a retrieval model with an adversarially trained model on a classification task can greatly improve its robustness to adversarial ranking attacks. Based on this observation, the authors further argue that initializing deep metric models with adversarially trained ones and then performing adversarial ranking defense can further improve their resistance to adversarial ranking attacks. Experimental results on multiple datasets support the authors' findings.

### Strengths
Strengths:

The paper has a simple and straightforward motivation, with a detailed description of the approach that is easy to replicate, which makes it accessible to researchers and practitioners alike.

The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experimental results, showing significant improvements over baseline methods with simple modifications. Besides, the authors provide experimental results on multiple datasets, which increases the robustness of their findings and reinforces the significance of their approach. This adds credibility to the research and strengthens the impact of the results.

This paper addresses an important problem in deep metric learning and explores the robustness of retrieval models against adversarial ranking attacks.

### Questions
- Can the authors provide a more comprehensive analysis or theoretical justification for why adversarial training initialization is particularly crucial for enhancing robustness in retrieval tasks? This would help to better understand the underlying mechanisms and provide insights into the importance of this approach in the context of retrieval models.

-Considering the characteristics of robust feature learning and the unique property of retrieval models, are there any specific modifications or adaptations that can be made to further optimize the utilization of adversarial training for improved robustness in retrieval? It would be valuable to explore how to harness the advantages of robust feature learning and tailor it specifically for retrieval tasks, rather than applying it in a generic manner.
