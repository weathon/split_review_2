# ChatEval: Towards Better LLM-based Evaluators through Multi-Agent Debate

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 5, 6, 5

## Abstract
Text evaluation has historically posed significant challenges, often demanding substantial labor and time cost. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), researchers have explored LLMs' potential as alternatives for human evaluation. While these single-agent-based approaches show promise, experimental results suggest that further advancements are needed to bridge the gap between their current effectiveness and human-level evaluation quality. 
Recognizing that best practices of human evaluation processes often involve multiple human annotators collaborating in the evaluation, we resort to a multi-agent debate framework, moving beyond single-agent prompting strategies.
The multi-agent-based approach enables a group of LLMs to synergize with an array of intelligent counterparts, harnessing their distinct capabilities and expertise to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in handling intricate tasks. In this paper, we construct a multi-agent referee team called \textbf{ChatEval} to autonomously discuss and evaluate the quality of generated responses from different models on open-ended questions and traditional natural language generation (NLG) tasks. We derive insights and lessons from practical scenarios where humans instigate group discussions for brainstorming and propose different communication strategies within ChatEval. Our experiments on two benchmark tasks illustrate that ChatEval delivers superior accuracy and correlation in alignment with human assessment. Furthermore, we find that the diverse role prompts (different personas) are essential in the multi-agent debate process; that is, utilizing the same role description in the prompt can lead to a degradation in performance. Our qualitative analysis also shows that ChatEval transcends mere textual scoring, offering a human-mimicking evaluation process for reliable assessments.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper focuses on the task of automatic text evaluation and highlights the limitations of existing n-gram metrics in correlating with human judgments. The authors propose ChatEval, a framework leveraging LLMs for automatic text evaluation. Instead of prompting a single LLM to assess the generation quality, ChatEval integrates multiple LLMs, facilitating debates among them to enhance the robustness and human-like quality of evaluation results.

### Strengths
1. The idea of using LLMs for automatic text evaluation is intriguing and holds potential.
2. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow. The inclusion of informative figures and tables enhances clarity.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper may benefit from providing more in-depth technical details about the ChatEval framework. While a prompt template is present in the appendix, the determination of LLM roles and the potential impact of varying roles and orders remain unclear. In addition, the framework relies on prompting LLMs, however, the paper lacks sufficient information on the design of prompts and their robustness.
2. The evaluation results present a challenge in assessing whether the multi-agent debate framework outperforms existing LLM-based evaluators in general cases. Addressing questions related to the listed questions would contribute to a more informed judgment.

### Questions
1. As mentioned in section 3.2, two agents are employed in the implementation of ChatEval. Can they always reach an agreement at the end of debates?

2. Regarding Table 2, does "MA" in the table represent multiple agents employed in the debating way. Are there corresponding results for multiple LLMs used in an ensemble manner, aligning with the methods in Table 1?

3. Considering the performance gap between G-EVAL-3.5 and ChatGPT(MA) in Table 2 for dialogue response generation, it appears that the effectiveness of the proposed framework is influenced by the chosen LLM. Has there been an evaluation of ChatEval's generalization ability?

4. It seems that the G-Eval framework can be easily adapted to open-ended QA evaluation. From the performance differences in Table 2 between G-Eval and ChatEval, I wonder whether the multiple-agent debating framework really works better than the single-agent COT framework?

### Summary
In this work, the authors propose a new framework called ChatEval that contains multiple debater agents to evaluate the quality of the text generated.  Each debater agent is an LLM aimed to generate responses based on prompts and there are 3 communication strategies followed between the multiple debater agents.
The authors evaluate the proposed approach on two benchmarks Fair Eval and Topical Chat and find that the proposed framework aligns closely with the human preferences.

### Strengths
1. The paper addresses an important problem of evaluating textual generations by using LLMs and trying to reduce the shortcomings faced with traditional human-based evaluations.
2. Results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on the FairEval and Topical Chat dataset by comparing it against various other frameworks on this dataset.

### Weaknesses
1. In the abstract, the authors mention that one of the drawbacks of using humans in the pipeline is the time and labor cost. The analysis of the proposed framework would benefit significantly if there is any analysis in terms of time spent by humans for annotation vs LLM. Specifically, the paper lacks a quantitative comparison of the time and cost involved in using the proposed ChatEval framework versus human evaluation. This makes it difficult to assess the practical advantages of the proposed method.
2. The framework seems to be suited only for short conversations based on the Analysis in Section 4.3. This would be an issue when extending this framework for evaluating longer dialogue conversations. The analysis does not provide sufficient details on how the summarization strategy would handle complex dialogues with multiple threads and dependencies. The framework's ability to maintain coherence and context in longer conversations remains unclear.



### Questions
1. In Tables 1 and 2 why is only Multi Agent (ChatEval) using the strategy of One-by-one mentioned? Why are results from other strategies not provided in the table?
2. In Section 3.3, it is claimed that Chateval surpasses Fair Eval's best results but this does not seem to be the case with regards to the Kappa correlation coefficient. 
3. How effective is the framework at detecting issues on hallucination which is quite common along LLMs?

### Summary
The paper introduces a new way of using LLMs for text evaluation through multi-agent discuss and evaluation. Instead of using the LLM to generate one round of evaluation, the authors propose to design multiple LLM agents with diverse roles, and let them go through several rounds of discussion to make the final evaluation. Results on one open question answering dataset, and one dialogue dataset demonstrates better alignment with human judgement for the proposed multi-agent framework. The authors also conduct additional experiments to examine individual components of the system, including the design of communication pattern among agents, diverse role of agents, number of agents involved and number of discussion rounds, which are helpful for future study.

### Strengths
1. The authors carefully study the different components of the multi-agent system, including the communication pattern, agent role design, number of agents and discussion rounds. The additional experiments for individual components and detailed discussion are very helpful for understanding the design choices and inform future research.
2. Results on two benchmarks showcase improvement of using multi-agent with both ChatGPT and GPT-4.

### Weaknesses
1. The experiments are conducted only on two datasets that are relative small. On Topical-Chat the win/loss of single-agent and multi-agent is mixed on different rubrics, and ChatGPT and GPT-4 seem to have different behaviors. Some more analysis on each rubric will be helpful rather than simply compare the improvement on average.
2. The experiments are conducted only with ChatGPT and GPT-4, thus unclear whether the proposed method could generalize to other LLMs, or limiting to GPT models. Evaluation on more models of different capacities could help understand when the multi-agent framework would work, is there emergent ability that require model with decent performance to have constructive discussion and evaluation.
3. There is no discussion on limitation of the proposed method. For example, the inference speed/cost will get affected given that multi-agent requires more rounds of generation with the LLM.
4. Some implementation details could be clarified.
    1. In section 3.2, it is mentioned that the default results are obtained with 2 agents, what are these 2 agents? Appendix describes the implementation of 5 agents, while in section 4.1 it is mentioned that there are three different roles.
    2. In section 4.1, the authors mentioned comparison between specific roles and default setting, but seems Figure 3 only includes results of specific roles.
    3. What is the specific version of ChatGPT and GPT-4 used in the paper, since that will affect model performance as well.

### Questions
Please see weakness above. In particular the clarification on implementation details/experiments and discussion on the limitation.

### Summary
This paper proposes ChatEval, a multi-agent framework for text evaluation that simulates human collaborative and argumentative dialogue. 
ChatEval demonstrates superior performance on two benchmarks, FairEval and Topical-Chat, compared to single-agent and other LLM-based methods.

### Strengths
1. The work has implications for the field of text evaluation, which aligns better with human preferences.

2. The authors have conducted extensive experiments and provided a thorough analysis of the results. The proposed method outperforms single-agent and other LLM-based methods on two benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

3. The work also highlighted the importance of diverse role prompts, which is a valuable insight for future research.

### Weaknesses
1. Figure 4 does not show whether simultaneous-talk-with-summarizer can outperform one-by-one. Although the chart has an upward trend, it is still necessary to further increase the Role Numbers and Discussion Turns to prove the author's point of view.

2. The specific examples of three different communication strategies are lacking, which can be put into the appendix.

3. The resource cost of ChatGPT/GPT-4 is a problem that needs to be considered, and the paper does not compare the resource consumption of previous methods with the proposed method.

### Questions
1. About fairness comparison. The setting of ChatEval is 2 agents with 2 discussion turns. It is not clear what the setting of Multi-Agent (Ensemble) is like.

2. More detailed about the Ensemble method.

### Summary
This paper presents ChatEval, a multi-agent debate framework that utilizes multiple LLMs to debate and evaluate the quality of machine-generated texts and improve the quality of the final text as a result of the process. The experiments consider two benchmarks: (1) FairEval along with human annotation results from Wu et al. (2023) – containing 80 open-ended questions with three annotators’ annotations on two model outputs and (2) Topical-Chat along with human annotation results from Mehri & Eskenazi (2020) – containing 60 dialogue contexts with human annotation on six model outputs. Based on the findings, the authors claim that ChatEval “delivers superior accuracy and correlation in alignment with human assessment.” In addition, they find that using diverse role prompts (using different personas) helps improve performance.

### Strengths
* Note that I’ve listed both strengths and weaknesses here as they are topically grouped together.
* The work provides a good list of related work and contextualizes itself in relation to prior/concurrent work. In doing so, however, it is unclear how the main goal of the proposed approach mirrors or differs from prior work (other than the proposed method itself; scoping the contribution/types of tasks more tightly can help here) and what kind of pros and cons or trade-offs there are in comparison to these other works that also leverage multiple LLMs. I’d encourage the authors to provide more information on this aspect both in introduction and related work, as I find the current explanation to be a bit hard to understand in the related work (i.e., “Concurrent with our work, Li et al. (2023b); Zhang et al. (2023) also propose a similar approach. However, they probe different dimensions of improving LLM-based evaluators and do not explore the effectiveness of natural language interaction.” In this sentence, what are “different dimensions” and what does “natural language interaction” mean here?)
* I think the idea of exploring diverse role specifications and communication strategies has a lot of potential. However, the current version that’s explored in the paper lacks depth and justification. For instance, there is one line justification for how the diverse role specification was formulated (“We take inspiration from Wu et al. (2023) and formulate an analogous role description.”), but it is unclear what other alternatives there are, why this is a good baseline to default to, what potential limitations are with this approach. Same thing applies to the design of communication strategies. The authors designed three strategies, but it is unclear how the design decisions were made and what factors are accounted for.
* Regarding the experiments, I have some concerns about the authors’ main claim. In Table 1, it’s unclear whether the difference between different methods is meaningful since it’s smaller than the difference between human annotators. More discussion on the inter-annotator agreement and how we should interpret the results would be necessary to make the claim about “superior accuracy and correlation”.  To account for a small number of instances, I’d highly encourage the authors to include standard deviations or errors on all tables and figures. On the other hand, I do appreciate that the authors delve into the importance of diverse role prompts, communication strategies, and the impact of role numbers and discussion turns. However, the qualitative analysis lacks nuance when reporting the finding; I’d be very cautious to call model behaviors “human-like” and “not just as a tool [...] but as an embodiment of interactive natural language dialogue” solely based on the four patterns observed in the experiments.
* Overall, I find the paper to have much room for improvement in terms of writing, need for more justification and explanation for design choices for the proposed method, and need more rigor in analyzing and reporting the experiment results.

### Questions
Minor suggestions
* In the abstract, I’d encourage the authors to include actual numerical results, as opposed to the textual description “superior accuracy and correlation”.
* In the abstract, it would be good to mention specific tasks or contexts that these claims are made.
* In Figure 1, if possible, showing actual (full) texts or abbreviated versions of texts (but longer than what it’s currently shown) would help readers understand how different model outputs (infused with different personas) contribute to overall performance boost.
* In the experiments section, the authors can clarify whether they use one model for all roles or use different models for different roles (it can be inferred from the results, but it’s better to clarify it before presenting the results).
* In Figure 4, the range on the y-axis should match in order to facilitate easy comparison between configurations.
