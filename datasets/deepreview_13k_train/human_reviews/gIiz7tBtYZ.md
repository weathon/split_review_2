- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
\vspace{-2mm} We introduce a novel neural network-based algorithm to compute optimal transport (OT) plans for general cost functionals. In contrast to common Euclidean costs, i.e., $\ell^1$ or $\ell^2$, such functionals provide more flexibility and allow using auxiliary information, such as class labels, to construct the required transport map. Existing methods for general cost functionals are discrete and do not provide an out-of-sample estimation. We address the challenge of designing a continuous OT approach for general cost functionals in high-dimensional spaces, such as images. We construct two example functionals: one to map distributions while preserving the class-wise structure and the other one to preserve the given data pairs. 
Additionally, we provide the theoretical error analysis for our recovered transport plans

### Summary
This paper proposes to study the so-called general cost OT problem, that is $\min_{\pi\in\Pi(P, Q)}F(\pi)$ where $F$ is a general functional and $|\Pi(P, Q)$ is the set of couplings between $P$ and $Q$. This is called general cost OT, because classical OT is a special case, taking $F(\pi) = \int c(x, y) d\pi$.
The authors derive a max-min reformulation for the approach as $\sup_{v}\inf_{\pi\in \Pi(P)} F(\Pi) - \int v d\pi(y) + \int v dQ(y)$, and then propose to parametrize the coupling $\pi$ as samples from $[x, T(x, z)]$ where $x\sim P$ , $z$ are samples from a Latent distribution like a Gaussian, and $T$ is a map that can itself be parameterized by a neural net. The potential $v$ is also parameterized by a NN.
In cases where the functional $F$ has a nice structure, the above max-min formulation can be estimated from random samples of $P, Q$ and $z$. 

The authors then provide an error analysis for the method where $F$ is strongly convex.

The main application of the method discussed in the paper is to do optimal transport that is faithful to labels. Given two mixtures $P = \sum \alpha_n P_n$ and $Q = \sum \beta_n Q_n$, the authors want to estimate a transport plan between P and Q that should also map, as well as possible, each $P_n$ to $Q_n$. The corresponding cost function, a sum of energy distances between $T\\#P_n$ and $Q_n$, fits nicely into the proposed general cost framework, as it can be estimated from samples using a (costly) U-statistics, and is different from classical OT costs.

The experiments are on toy MNIST, KMNIST and fashion MNIST datasets, where the authors try to match each class. They compute the corresponding FID between mapped source and target dataset, and accuracy on the mapped set of a resnet trained on the target set.

### Strengths
The paper is very well written and easy to follow.
The algorithm developed in the paper is sound, and is an interesting method to estimate transport plans for general costs.
The theoretical results of the paper are interesting. 
The problem of optimal transport with label faithfulness is also interesting for ML applications, and the proposed method is an elegant solution.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness of this paper is the experimental validation.
- the setup is very toyish: the datasets are toy datasets, and the labels are entirely unrelated: why match the digit '1' to 'trouser'? This is fine as a first toy experiment but there must be some more interesting ML applications where the labels from P and from Q have a relationship and are not paired randomly: having only this artificial experiment is underwhelming, and does not convince the reader that it is actually an interesting problem for machine learning.
- what does fig.3 show ? the description is far too short. Some methods are stochastic (i.e. T(x, z) with z random), how is the sample chosen? 
- Same question for the metrics: how it is computed for stochastic outputs could be clearer. is it averaged over z?
- is FID computed per class or on the whole dataset? this should be clarified.
- all fonts are too small in the figures

Another point is that the cost function proposed in Prop.1 contains a quadruple sum over samples: a discussion about its variance would be welcome. Also, the proposition mentions that it is an estimator: in which sense?

### Questions
See above.


Misc. minor remarks:
- in the abstract, the use of transport "map" vs "plan" can be confusing
- Why write $\mathcal{X} = \mathcal{Y}$ in the notation? why bother with two spaces if they are the same.
- $\gamma$ is used for two different things on top of page 3
- "The performance of such methods in high dimensions is questionable": a reference to elaborate on this would be welcome.
- In eq.6, the second $\sup \inf$ can be removed to make it clearer what $\mathcal{L}$ is.
- middle of page 5: "it follows by solving (2)"  I think this refers to the unlabeled equation in corollary (2), not to eq.(2). Same with "Overall, Problem (2)" shortly after. It would probably be best to number the equation in corollary 7.
- "it does not always have a solution with each P_n exactly mapped to Q_n" a few more words about why this is the case would be nice.
- "we employ the Sinkhorn"
- what is the baseline accuracy of each resnet used in the experiments?

### Summary
The paper discusses the problem of computing optimal transportation plans for a general cost functional. In particular, the paper proposes a max-min formulation of the problem, provides theoretical consistency results, and a stochastic optimization algorithm to numerically solve it. The problem is motivated by a "dataset transfer problem" where class labels are required to be preserved with the transportation plan. The proposed algorithm is illustrated on an a toy example with moon dataset and an example involving image dataset.

### Strengths
- The topic of the paper is interesting and valuable to the researchers
- The paper is written with mathematical rigor
- The proposed algorithm is supported by theoretical arguments and numerical experiments 
- The theoretical results are important and useful

### Weaknesses
1- The novelty of the paper, in comparison to Ref[1], is weak. 
- The theoretical novelty, in comparison to the existing theoretical result in Ref[1] is not explained well (what is the new approach or new tool that is being used here). What are the challenges of considering a general cost functional that the previous approach could not handle.   
- The computational algorithm is also very similar. The NOT algorithm block in Ref[1] can be simply extended to general cost functional. The proposed algorithm block is very similar, with the only difference that it is written for a class-guided functional.       

2 - As I was reading the paper, I found the motivation, the theoretical discussion, and the numerical examples a bit disconnected. If the main contribution of the paper is the OT with general cost functional, it is necessary to provide several examples of a general cost functional, rather than just focusing on class guided cases. If the main goal of the paper is to do the class guided transportation, it should be reflected in the title, there should be more motivation why this is useful in practice, and what are the existing approaches for this particular problem. 

3 - The comparison with the existing OT approaches does not seem fair as they do not optimize the same cost function as your apporach. A possible comparison is to use the existing OT algorithms to do to transportation for each class separately, resulting in 10 different maps (for the MNIST case) and discuss how your proposed method, which only trains one map, is computationally more efficient, while the loss in accuracy is not significant.

### Questions
- It is interesting to see and discuss how the algorithm performs when the data from classes overlap. 
- Regarding the discussion at the beginning of Sec 3.2., why is there a "measurable" map for each coupling? I understand existence for each x, but not sure how to argue existence of a measurable map as a function of x and z.

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel neural network-based algorithm for computing optimal transport plans (OT) for cost functionals that go beyond typical Euclidean costs like $\ell^1$ or $\ell^2$. These functionals offer greater flexibility and allow the incorporation of auxiliary information, such as class labels, in constructing the transport map. 

Existing methods for general costs are discrete and lack out-of-sample estimation capabilities. The paper addresses the challenge of designing a continuous OT approach for general costs that can generalize to new data points in high-dimensional spaces like images. Additionally, it provides theoretical error analysis for the recovered transport plans. 

As an application, the paper demonstrates how to construct a cost functional that maps data distributions while preserving class-wise structures.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-structured with a clear motivation, thorough literature review, rigorous theoretical analysis, comprehensive numerical experiments, detailed implementation, and insightful discussions.
- The paper expands upon existing neural OT techniques to accommodate general cost functionals, offering potential applications in mapping data distributions while maintaining class-wise structures.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper heavily draws upon the prior work of (Korotin et al. 2023a) for its theoretical foundations. Approximately 5 out of 9 pages are dedicated to presenting these theoretical results, which may not constitute the primary novelty of the paper. Based on my personal reading, it seems that the authors might be overselling their theoretical contributions, potentially leading to a less reader-friendly introduction.
- The paper exceeds the strict upper limit of 9 pages for the main text of the submission by including a section on reproducibility (Section 7) on Page 10. As a reviewer, this doesn't pose an issue for me, but I would advise adhering to the prescribed page limits as a matter of following the rules.
- A direct comparison of the theoretical findings with those presented in (Korotin et al. 2023a) is essential. Readers are likely seeking a consolidated presentation rather than having to review two separate papers with overlapping theoretical content.
- From my perspective, the paper's novelty appears to lie more in its practical applications, particularly in utilizing a cost functional to map data distributions while maintaining class-wise structures. In light of this, it would be beneficial for the paper to allocate more of its main text to discussing practical implementation aspects.
- From my own interests, I would find it valuable if the paper could delve further into potential applications involving general cost functionals.

### Summary
This paper proposes a general OT formulation, which uses a functional \mathcal{F} to encompass common objectives and regularizers as special cases. The authors introduced a method for addressing the continuous general OT problem and illustrated how a general functional \mathcal{F} can incorporate information, such as the presence of class labels in the data. To validate the method, the authors use synthetic datasets and various MNIST datasets for testing.

### Strengths
The closest prior work appears to be the study by Korotin et al. (2023b), as cited in the paper. Building upon this previous research, the authors demonstrate how one can preserve the class-label structure in OT. This contribution is novel to my knowledge.

### Weaknesses
As I understand it, one benefit of employing a general functional F is to account for the class-label structure. Are there any other intended applications of a general F? If the sole purpose is to consider the class-label structure, perhaps some proofs (e.g., the proof to Theorem 3) could be simplified.

I do not fully understand the image data experiments depicted in Fig 3(a) and (b) in section 5.2, and I would appreciate it if the authors could provide further explanation. From my understanding, the goal here is to identify an optimal transport (OT) map between two data distributions (e.g., the distribution of MNIST and KMNIST images) while preserving the class correspondence. To achieve this, one could visualize several source images from the same class in the source dataset and check if the corresponding target images are from the same class. However, Fig 3 appears to display only a single source image per class (top rows) along with a target image per class (2nd rows), making it unclear whether the class correspondence is preserved overall. 

Another reason why Figures 3(a) and 3(b) are challenging to understand is the absence of a natural correspondence between the classes of MNIST -> KMNIST and FMNIST -> MNIST images. It is thus difficult to check the correspondence visually. To enhance visualization, would it be reasonable to use only a single dataset, such as MNIST, and establish the correspondence of images from class 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 to a permuted class order, such as 1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 0? This approach would help to visualize the class correspondence.
