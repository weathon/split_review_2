- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5, 5

## Abstract
As the deployment of autonomous agents increases in real life, there is an increased interest in extending their usage to competitive environments populated by other robots. Self-play in Reinforcement Learning (RL) allows agents to explore and learn competitive strategies. However, the complex dynamics of multi-agent RL interactions introduce instability in training and susceptibility to overfitting. Several game-theoretic approaches address the latter by generating approximate Nash equilibrium strategies to train against. The challenge of learning a policy in a complex and unstable multi-agent environment, the former, is not yet well addressed. This paper aims to address this issue by using a curriculum learning approach. We introduce curriculum design by a genetic algorithm to the multi-agent domain to more efficiently learn a policy that performs well and is stable at Nash equilibrium. Empirical studies show that our approach outperforms several strong baselines across various competitive two-player benchmarks in continuous control settings.

### Summary
To learn policies in complex and unstable MARL environment and game-theoretic setup, this paper presented a curriculum learning method using the Genetic algorithm. Its main contributions include 1) population-wide genetic operations (crossover) 2) introducing a regret to accommodate the difficulty level of genetically generated scenario, and 3) continuously optimized open-loop opponents to stabilize early learning. Ablation and empirical study demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and design choices.

### Strengths
1.	The paper studies an important problem in MARL. It is well motivated and organized

2.	Empirical evaluation on three domains demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method comparing to a few baselines

### Weaknesses
1.	Some related work are missing (see question 1 and 2)

[1] Evolutionary Population Curriculum for Scaling Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Qian Long, Zihan Zhou, Abhibav Gupta, Fei Fang, Yi Wu, Xiaolong Wang, ICLR2020

[2] Learning Multi-Objective Curricula for Robotic Policy Learning
J Kang, M Liu, A Gupta, C Pal, X Liu, J Fu, CoRL2022

2.	The study is mostly empirical, no theoretical analysis is provided regarding convergence, computational and sample complexity
3.	There are some claims without clear justification (see question3)

### Questions
1.	To me, the purpose of this work is to use curriculum learning to address the complexity of policy learning for multiagent tasks. There are two major dimensions for characterizing the complexity of a problem, one is from the large state space and its associated dynamics(exogenous), the other one is due to the interaction among multiple agent. It seems to me that this paper is mainly focus on the first aspect of the complexity, which is not unique to the multiple agent problem. Can the same method be applied to single cases?
2.	How about the second source of complexity. In other words, how the method will perform in there the number of agent is large? Ref [1] already provided a solution method by using evolution algorithm which is simpler than genetic algorithm, except that there is no crossover is considered.  The value of this work would be significant enhanced if such as aspect is considered.
3.	In section 3.4 it is mentioned that “instead of searching for the global optimum, the student agent will often exploit…”. It is unclear to me what does “global optimum” mean? Do you mean pareto optimum?
4.	What are u and \delta in Algorithm1?
5.	In section 4.3, first paragraph, “…intensive algorithms like PONG…” What is PONG? 
6.	Given the description in the second paragraph of section 3.1, do you assume that the agents are homogenous?
7.	There are quite a few typos needs to the fixed, please proof read.

### Summary
This paper introduces a population-wide genetic algorithm that aims to optimise agents in competitive multi-player settings. In particular, it utilises curriculum learning techniques to generate both scenarios and opponents in order to improve the training process of an agent.

### Strengths
- In general, the paper is fairly well-written and the method is described adequately. 
- Whilst the curriculum learning aspect of the paper is not necessarily truly novel, combining it across both the environment and the opponent players I believe is novel. Frameworks like PSRO only perform curriculum learning by selecting appropriate opponents, but ignore the underlying environment, whilst single-agent curriculum learning approaches obviously only generate curriculums on the environment. Therefore, in my opinion performing the curriculum learning is an obvious step but is mostly original work.
- The experimental results suggest that this is a fruitful approach on all of the environments.

### Weaknesses
 - Whilst I understand the intentions by the blind agent, from what is provided in the main text I am struggling a bit in figuring out the implementation. For example, how is the action selected? In addition, why this approach in particular? Could we not get a similar result by e.g. applying noise to the policy when a blind agent is chosen to be used? What about just a random policy?
- The curriculum learning aspects of the environments evaluated in the paper are very limited. For example, in Volley the initial velocity of the ball does provide an obvious form of curriculum (start slow and speed up as agent gets better), however this is incredibly simple and does not provide really provide much signal for the agent. I think it would be much more interesting if this framework was tested in environments where there exists a lot of potential complexity in the underlying environment, that can also be stripped down to a simple version for the curriculum (e.g. single-agent MiniGrid has much more scope for going from basic to complex unlike these environments, in my opinion)

### Questions
I would appreciate if the authors could address the concerns I highlighted in the weaknesses section. Primarily:

1) Implementation details of the Blind Agent and why this specific design was selected

2) Why these environments were selected, and if the underlying environments have enough customisability to generate curricula that are useful

### Summary
This paper presents GEMS that addresses unstable training of existing work towards Nash caused by complex multi-agent interactions. Specifically, GEMS applies 1) population-wide genetic operations, 2) regret to evaluate the difficulty of a generated scenario, and 3) continuously optimized opponents, environment parameters, and the blind agent. Experimental evaluations in Pong, Volley, and ACM show the effectiveness of GEMS compared to competing baselines.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and addresses the important challenge of learning in difficult multi-agent domains.
2. The paper conducts extensive crossplay experiments (e.g., Table 6) and shows the positive results of GEMS.

### Weaknesses
1. GEMS would have a limited novelty with respect to prior work: the population-wide genetic operations (e.g., crossover) are studied in GC and the use of regret for curriculum learning is studied in MAESTRO. As such, GEMS could be viewed as combining two papers with the addition of the blind agent. 
2. Related to #1, the ablation study in Section 5.3 shows that the use of the blind agent is an important factor in GEMS. However, the initial behavior of the blind agent is manually set by a human (e.g., the blind agent is set to circle around the ego agent (Section 5.2)). As such, GEMS would require a human to manually tune the initial blind agent. 
3. The paper states that "Over time, those opponents will evolve toward the Nash equilibrium". However, there are no theoretical analyses, and it is unclear from empirical evaluations that GEMS converges to Nash equilibrium. 
4. It is unclear how to scale GEMS to more complex multi-agent domains that involve images as agent inputs. Also, the problem statement (Equation 1) in Section 3.1 is only with respect to the ego agent, so it is unclear when there is more than one ego agent in settings.

### Questions
1. I hope to ask the authors' responses to my concerns about the limited novelty, human requirement, Nash justification, and limited scalability (please refer to the weaknesses section for details).
2. In Figure 2, it is unclear what each color represents. Adding a legend in the figure could help. 
3. Missing reference: "[?]" in Section 3.3
4. Typo: "a stat a state-of-the-art approach" in Section 4.2

### Summary
The authors propose a Curriculum Learning approach for Adversarial 1x1 RL. A Genetic Algorithm generates tasks (i.e., samples opponents) that the agent can use to train, with the purpose to improve it's general performance against a general opponent.

### Strengths
- Work is relevant to ICLR and adherent to the recent body of research on RL.
- The idea of generating a Curriculum of tasks to learn how to play against a population of opponents is reasonable and has good applicability to practical applications.
- Authors present evaluation domains of high complexity (as far as 1x1 domains go).

### Weaknesses
 - The approach is very unclear from the general modeling to how the experiments were performed. It's very hard to judge if the modeling is realistic and the experiments were carried out in a fair way. I will break down the main sources of confusion below:

 -- It is not clear to me what is the "population" of agents that the ego agent has to beat on equation (2). In a practical application, is the agent expected to have to beat an unknown population of agents? If the population is unknown (which sounds to me a more realistic modeling), how is the agent able to generate the strategies it plays against when the curriculum is created? If the population of opponents is known beforehand (which sounds very unrealistic for most applications), it explains how the agent can generate the curriculum. It remains unclear if the algorithm computes the optimal opponent strategy or if it selects from a set of pre-existing strategies, and how those strategies are generated in the first place. This needs to be clarified in the manuscript.

 -- I don't quite understand what is a "solution" for the GA so that crossover and mutation is applied. The agent can realistically pick which opponent it is going to play against for a particular episode, what else composes the "curriculum task:? how are those combined/mutated. Those are key elements of the proposed algorithm and are not clearly explained in the main text of the paper. In special, I cannot understand what the agent has the power to manipulate to generate a new "curriculum task". The paper needs to provide a detailed explanation of how scenario encodings are generated for new tasks, including concrete examples of how these encodings are structured for different types of environments and opponents.

 -- The "blind agent" sounds to be a very ad hoc addition to the algorithm. How should this blind agent be developed for a new domain? Is there an automated way of generating it? I assume just generating an agent with random actions would have no effect given that for any reasonably-complex task a random agent would be very easily beaten. If the blind agent simply applies random actions, it would be a trivial opponent, and training against it would not provide much benefit beyond ensuring the agent is better than a random policy. This could lead to issues in more complex domains.

 -- It's not clear what are the 5 "baseline opponents" used to test the algorithms in the experimental evaluation. Are the agents aware of those opponents and able to use them for training for as long as they have remaining training steps? or are they held out just for generating metrics. An interesting way of validating the algorithms would be to have a number of high-performance strategies they can manipulate to play against during training, and a number of unknown strategies that are never seen by the agents and only used for calculating the performance metrics. In this way you would actually be evaluating how general is the learned strategy.

 -- How strong are the strategies that the agents had to beat in the experiments, and how were them learned? In the evaluation, there should be at least one adaptive agent that is given time to learn how to "hack" the ego agent strategy.

- THe literature review was very limited on the transfer of information and curriclum in multi-agent systems. I was surprised that the authors did not mention the first survey to suggest to develop multi-agent curricula of evolving strategies:

Silva, Felipe Leno Da, and Anna Helena Reali Costa. "A survey on transfer learning for multiagent reinforcement learning systems." Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 64 (2019): 645-703.

Also, while the agents knowing and controlling the opponent strategies sounds unrealistic, they could easily model then and build Curricula based on modeled versions of those opponents:

Stefano V. Albrecht, Peter Stone, Autonomous agents modelling other agents: A comprehensive survey and open problems, Artificial Intelligence, Volume 258, 2018.

One issue that some Curriculum Learning approaches observed is that it is hard to figure out how many tasks have to be generated. One popular approach executes a random walk based on the task transferability to prune huge Curricula:

Silva, F. L. D., & Costa, A. H. R. (2018, July). Object-oriented curriculum generation for reinforcement learning. In Proceedings of the 17th international conference on autonomous agents and multiagent systems (pp. 1026-1034).

### Questions
1) How much knowledge do the agents have about the real "opponent population".
2) What exactly is manipulated by the GA to generate new tasks?
3) Why is the "blind agent" development not added to the algorithm?
4) Where do the strategy from the opponents in the experiments come from? Are there adaptive agents as opponents?
