# UGC: UNIVERSAL GRAPH COARSENING

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 3, 6

## Abstract
In the era of big data, graphs have emerged as a natural representation for intricate relationships. However, graph sizes often become unwieldy, leading to storage, computation, and analysis challenges. A crucial demand arises for methods that can effectively downsize large graphs while retaining vital insights. Graph coarsening seeks to simplify large graphs while maintaining essential features. Most published methods are suitable for homophilic datasets, limiting their universal use. We propose Universal Graph Coarsening (UGC), a framework equally suitable for homophilic and heterophilic datasets. UGC integrates node attributes and adjacency information, leveraging the dataset's heterophily factor and is a first ever linear time-complexity framework. Results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that UGC preserves spectral similarity while coarsening. In comparison to state of the art methods, UGC is 4x to 15x faster, has lower eigen-error, and yields superior performance on downstream processing tasks even at 70\% coarsening ratios.

### Summary
The authors propose a graph coarsening algorithm that works in heterophilic scenarios by borrowing from locality sensitive hashing (LSH) literature. To do so, they consider the node feature vector in addition to the adjacency matrix. The core idea is to map nodes using this augmented matrix to the same node using an appropriately instantiated LSH. To validate the quality of the coarsening, the authors consider relative eigen error, hyperbolic error, and, to account for the feature vector, bounded $\epsilon$-similarity. They show computational gains over previous coarsening state-of-the-art in terms of memory and compute time. To demonstrate the applicability of their approach, the authors train a single hidden layer GCN, and show that training on the coarsened graph has negligible impact on accuracy while benefiting from computational gains when tested on the original graph for predictions.

### Strengths
- The approach seems intuitive and there is a simplicity appeal to an adjacency augmented node feature vector.
- The results seem promising (even if the downstream task is more illustratory than extensive)

### Weaknesses
 - Section 3.4 is not a time complexity analysis, and no appropriate appendix is present. Crucially, it is unclear how the hidden loop on Line 14 in Algorithm 1 is maintained as O(N) rather than O(N^2). A time complexity analysis section should not leave finding all hidden loops in mixed pseudo-code and mathematical notation algorithms as an exercise for the reader. The empirical results indeed hint that the time cost benefits exist, but as the linear time claim is made in the abstract and introduction, this section requires considerable improvement.
- The choice of downstream GNN architecture feels unjustified. Why specifically convolution instead of GIN, or GAT? More concretely, how should a reader know that the coarsening benefits are not specific to GCN but rather more universally exploitable? Additionally, low eigen error is shown as a benefit, but no investigation was made to show if, for example, the coarsening maps to community detection when performed using spectral methods.

### Summary
The paper presents a strategy called UGC to coarsen an attributed graph to a smaller graph, while preserving certain desirable traits (e.g., certain spectral properties). The algorithm uses locality sensitive hashing to operate in a fast manner, and is empirically tested in a number of tasks.

### Strengths
The problem is certainly relevant and the idea of employing locality sensitive hashing appears novel.
I believe there are several interesting ideas encapsulated in this paper, which appear however to be not fully developed

### Weaknesses
 * The paper is written in a somewhat haphazard way: the notation and introduced concepts remain often unclear and the paper lacks a clear structure and organization in my opinion.

* Problem formulation -- what precisely is the mathematical objective that UGC tries to achieve? This is not clearly stated. 
The set S does not define the set of indicator matrices the authors seem to have in mind (there are matrices that fulfill those constraints that are not indicator matrices). Why introduce it this way? Also C is supposed to be N times n, yet the example given is n times N.

* The discussion on heterophily appears out of the blue -- it is not clear what relevance it has to the paper and the technique used.

* The discussion on related work is pretty mixed, but it is not always clear on what these relations are build. There is a whole literature on network summarization, which appears to be largely ignored that is much closer to the type of problems discussed in this paper.

* The notation and decsription in section 3.1 is unclear to me. What are the asterisks as opposed to \cdot denote? Figure 3 does not really help much either as it is rather cryptic.

* Section 3.2. and 3.3 are not well written either. There is an algorithm but the idea of it is hardly explained and the intuition remains completely absent in my opinion.

* Section 4 appears to be a long list of quality criteria, whose relative merits and selection is never discussed. Symbols appear that have not been introduced before etc.

* It is not really clear what questions the experimental session tries to answer and why. For instance, yes, run-time can be important, but only in conjunction with some other assessment of the quality of the coarsening -- what does 50% coarsening even mean for the other methods? How would you coarsen a graph to 50% by kron reduction -- there are many options. It is not clear what we are comparing here..

Overall the paper appears to have been put together in a rushed manner. There are many typos and grammatical mistakes throughout, the organization is not clear, and the key messages get lost in details.

### Summary
This paper gives a graph coarsening algorithm based on random projections. The nodes are repeatedly hashed using a random projections, and then assigned to vertices in the smaller graphs via a majority scheme.

Guarantees of this reduction scheme are given via properties of random projections. The effectiveness of this coarsening scheme are then experimentally measured, demonstrating good efficiency, preservation of spectral properties, and in training of graph neural networks.

### Strengths
The random projection based scheme is natural, and is well known to be among the most efficient possible. The experiments are quite extensive, and demonstrate a lot of useful and intriguing properties about this coarsening scheme.

### Weaknesses
Some of the formal derivations were a bit difficult to parse, e.g. in equation (1) on page 2, what is the <C_l, C_l> term? I also mistook the \forall i \neq j before it to be for this term too because it included a d_i.

Also, in theorem 4.2, it's not clear what the role of x is.

After equation (5), it's not clear what the `proof in Appendix A.7' is for (is it missing a theorem statement here?)

I had difficulties finding a concise summary of the theoretical guarantees (in terms of the graph Laplacian) proven about this coarsening scheme. Would it be possible to point to a 'main theorem' that's proven?
