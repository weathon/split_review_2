- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 1, 5, 8

## Abstract
With the increasing emphasis on data privacy, the significance of machine unlearning has grown substantially. Class unlearning, which involves enabling a trained model to forget data belonging to a specific class learned before, is important as classification tasks account for the majority of today's machine learning as a service (MLaaS). Retraining the model on the original data, excluding the data to be forgotten (also known as forgetting data), is a common approach to class unlearning. However, the availability of original data during the unlearning phase is not always guaranteed, leading to the exploration of class unlearning with restricted data access, which has attracted considerable attention. While current unlearning methods with restricted data access usually generate proxy sample via the trained neural network classifier, they typically focus on training and forgetting balanced data. However, the imbalanced original data can cause trouble for these proxies and unlearning, particularly when the forgetting data consists predominantly of the majority class. To address this issue, we propose the GENerative Imbalanced Unlearning (GENIU) framework. GENIU utilizes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to concurrently train a proxy generator alongside the original model. These generated proxies accurately represent each class and are leveraged in the unlearning phase, eliminating the reliance on the original training data. To further mitigate the performance degradation resulting from forgetting the majority class, we introduce an ``in-batch tuning'' strategy which works with the generated proxies. GENIU is the first practical framework for class unlearning in imbalanced data settings and restricted data access, ensuring the preservation of essential information for future unlearning. Experimental results confirm the superiority of GENIU over existing methods, establishing its effectiveness in empirical scenarios.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new method for approximate unlearning of in a class imbalanced setting with restricted data access., called GENIU. GENIU employs a VAE to simultaneously train a substitute generator in conjunction with the main model. The paper uses experiments to validate claims.

### Strengths
The clarity of the work is acceptable. Furthermore, the work is highly novel and original. The usage of VAE seems cool.

### Weaknesses
However, I find the following critical faults with the paper:

- The baselines seem ill-defined. In the presented experiments, there is not a good way of knowing what constitutes a good delta in classification based on an unlearning request. In the results table, the authors show that after unlearning, the accuracy for the unlearned class is 0.0. I do not understand why there is any merit in this. Throughout the entire paper, there is never any mention of what constitutes a valid "forgetting" of a given class (as an exact definition). It seems that the implied definition (based on the results) is that the accuracy on the forgotten class should be zero. I disagree that this is a useful definition.
- The formulation seems ill-defined. The authors do not do a precise job of describing the setting. For example: how imbalanced must the classes be for this method to work? How large of a fraction of unlearning can this method support? 
- The motivation is unclear -- the authors fail to explain either practical or intellectual motivation for proposing this algorithm. I am left wondering why this setting matters.
- The method seems overly complicated --- the authors fail to include simpler methods and show that they fail.

### Questions
I would like to see:

1 - a stronger formulation section. This paper fails to defined the goals formally.
2 - more motivation
3 - better baselines

While the algorithm proposed is interesting, I feel there is significant work to be done before this is ready for publication.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel approach to class unlearning for imbalanced data called GENIU. The framework utilizes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate accurate proxies for the forgetting data, even when it consists predominantly of the majority class. The proposed GENIU is divided into training phase and unlearning phase. During the training phase, the VAE is trained to generate accurate proxies for the forgetting data. During the unlearning phase, the VAE is used to generate proxies for the forgetting data, which are then used to update the model. The paper's contributions include a detailed description of the GENIU algorithm, an evaluation of its performance on several benchmark datasets, and a discussion of its potential applications and future research directions.

### Strengths
- This paper is well-written and easy for readers to understand, and its key idea is clear.

- This paper deals with scenarios that could occur in the real world, such as situations where access to original data is not possible or where a classification model is trained on imbalanced data. These are plausible constraints, and the paper provides sufficient approaches to address them.

- The authors conducted sufficient experiments to explain their algorithms and also conducted a thorough analysis of it. They provide examples such as explaining the storage space advantage, unlearning for various classes, and multi-class unlearning.

### Weaknesses
 - The authors train a generative model together with a classification model at the beginning. However, this can be a critical privacy issue because the generative model itself contains information about the forgetting data. Although this can be discarded after one unlearning process, it cannot be used for the next unlearning process. Therefore, it seems to be an architecture that cannot perform continuous unlearning.

- The generated proxies are mentioned to be far from the decision boundary. In other words, the model successfully classifies them with high confidence. However, the statement that high-entropy data is selected for learning this contradicts this idea. Shouldn't the opposite data be selected for this? The explanation for these aspects is more clearly explained. 

- The paper does not address how GENIU scales with significantly larger datasets or more complex models. This leaves questions about its feasibility in highly demanding real-world scenarios. It would be better to provide a more detailed comparative analysis, especially highlighting specific scenarios where GENIU might not be the optimal choice.

- There are sentences that appear to be grammar errors and typos. Examples include "~ imbalanced data, if train the proxies throught the ~" in "4. our method", "ALLCNN 20 epochs ~ noise z the" in "5. implementation detail", and "unmber" in "algorithm 1". The authors seem to need to pay more attention to these errors.

### Questions
- I can understand that the method of generating proxies using a well-trained model as a guide contains many characteristics of the majority class. However, it seems that there is a lack of analysis on how the approach of training both the classification model and the generation model together addresses the issue of imbalanced characteristics. Ultimately, it appears that the authors' idea is correct, but I'm curious about why that is the case.

- During the training process, learning from noisy images is also carried out. Isn't it valid to do this when the performance of the classification model is reasonably assured? Isn't it possible to save noisy images that happened to match when the performance is low?

- I'm wondering whether the authors have considered a method involving the use of a negative value in the formulation of the loss function for forgetting data, as they took the reciprocal.

- Is one mini-batch sufficient? Why is that?

- Could you provide more insight into the assumption that all minority classes have similar data counts? How might GENIU perform if faced with varying levels of class imbalance within a dataset?

### Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to address the problem of class unlearning under a crucial challenge in learning from imbalanced data with restricted data access. Unlike traditional retraining methods that rely on the original data, this study introduces a special proxy generator method and an in-batch tuning strategy tailored for scenarios where the forgetting data predominantly consists of majority class samples. The proposed generator employs a generative approach to create a limited set of proxies for each class, effectively mitigating the impact of imbalanced data on the representation of minority classes. Additionally, the method introduces privacy-preserving measures by using noisy samples as generator seeds rather than relying on original training data. The empirical results demonstrate superior performance in both efficiency and effectiveness, showcasing the method's potential for practical applications.

### Strengths
This paper introduces a novel approach to address the challenging problem of imbalanced class unlearning with restricted data access. Unlike conventional retraining methods, the proposed special proxy generator method and in-batch tuning strategy offer a new perspective on efficiently unlearning from imbalanced data, particularly when forgetting data is predominantly composed of majority class samples. The paper's innovative use of a generative approach for proxy generation, as well as the integration of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and in-batch tuning, showcases a creative combination of existing ideas, pushing the boundaries of current knowledge in this domain.
The empirical results of this study demonstrate excellent quality in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. The proposed method exhibits superior performance, effectively mitigating the impact of imbalanced data on the representation of minority classes. The rigorous experimental validation underscores the robustness and reliability of the proposed approach, ensuring its applicability in real-world settings. Additionally, the introduction of privacy-preserving measures with noisy samples as generator seeds adds an extra layer of quality assurance.
The paper addresses a critical challenge in learning from imbalanced data with restricted data access. By focusing on class unlearning, the study not only defines a specific problem formulation but also offers a solution that has potential implications for various domains and applications. The introduction of a method that does not rely on original training data, regardless of forgetting or retaining it, marks a substantial advancement in the field. Furthermore, the efficient use of storage and time resources enhances the practical relevance and impact of the proposed method. The comprehensive empirical studies provided in the paper further solidify its motivation and validate the superiority of the proposed methods over existing approaches.

### Weaknesses
There are clarity issues in the technical details and notation definitions. Specifically, the rationale behind the assumption that all minority classes have a comparable volume of data needs further elaboration. The paper does not adequately explain whether this assumption is driven by the significance of the imbalance rate as a critical hyperparameter. It is unclear how the method would perform if the minority classes exhibited different data distributions. For example, in a scenario with 10 classes where the majority class has 1000 samples, and the minority classes have between 10 and 100 samples each, would the proposed method still be effective? Additionally, the paper does not sufficiently clarify why the knowledge of the generator cannot be accurately obtained in the unlearning phase (at the beginning of 2nd paragraph, Sec 4.1). The statement is made without proper justification. Furthermore, the use of \(\sigma\) and \(\mu\) in Eq 5 is not defined in the main text but only in the title of Figure 2, making it difficult for the reader to understand if they are parameters of the Gaussian distribution. Finally, the meaning of \(D_s\) at the end of Sec 4.4 is not defined, creating confusion. Some related work discussions also lack clarity in illustrating how the challenges posed by the problem studied in this paper specifically affect those approaches. The paper would benefit from a more detailed explanation of how existing methods fail under the specific constraints outlined in this study. Furthermore, the assumption of similar data volumes for all minority classes requires clarification. It remains unclear whether this assumption is driven by the criticality of the imbalance rate as a hyperparameter in this paper. These clarity issues collectively pose potential barriers to a comprehensive understanding of the paper's technical content.

Additionally, there are some typos, such as "with the retraining of a new model" instead of "retaining of a new model." In the section discussing learning and unlearning from imbalanced data, the phrase "some shards may ..." could benefit from a more precise expression like "some shards may be composed of."

Another aspect to consider is that the proposed method entails generator training during the overall training process rather than relying on a pre-trained model. While this may impose certain limitations on the method's applicability, this unique approach also plays a crucial role in addressing the imbalance issue during generator training.

### Questions
1) The rationale behind assuming that all minority classes have a comparable volume of data warrants further clarification. Is this assumption driven by the significance of the imbalance rate as a critical hyperparameter in this paper? Moreover, it would be beneficial to address what implications arise if the minority classes do not exhibit a similar distribution of data. Providing
2) Why the knowledge of the generator cannot be accurately obtained in the unlearning phase? (at the beginning of 2nd paragraph, Sec 4.1)
3) \sigma and \mu in Eq 5 is not defined in the main text but in the title of Figure 2. Are they the parameters of the gaussian distribution?
4) What is D_s at the end of Sec 4.4?
