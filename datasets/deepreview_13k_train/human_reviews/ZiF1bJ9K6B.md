# Learning Coverage Paths in Unknown Environments with Reinforcement Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 3, 5, 5

## Abstract
Coverage path planning (CPP) is the problem of finding a path that covers the entire free space of a confined area, with applications ranging from robotic lawn mowing to search-and-rescue. When the environment is unknown, the path needs to be planned online while mapping the environment, which cannot be addressed by offline planning methods that do not allow for a flexible path space. We investigate how suitable reinforcement learning is for this challenging problem, and analyze the involved components required to efficiently learn coverage paths, such as action space, input feature representation, neural network architecture, and reward function. We propose a computationally feasible egocentric map representation based on frontiers, and a novel reward term based on total variation to promote complete coverage. Through extensive experiments, we show that our approach surpasses the performance of both previous RL-based approaches and highly specialized methods across multiple CPP variations.

### Summary
This paper presents a reinforcement learning approach for online coverage path planning in unknown environments. The authors use a continuous action space for the agent in their formulation, with the model directly predicting the low level control signals. When compared to prior work, the main contribution seems to be the choice of observation representations and the reward function. Observation data is represented through multi-scale egocentric maps to enable long-term planning while maintaining scalable input representation. Additionally, the introduction of frontier maps helps retain information about uncovered spaces in larger-scale maps. The authors propose a reward function with a total variation term to reduce small uncovered areas within the environment. The approach is tested on tasks such as exploration and lawn mowing, showing improved performance over existing reinforcement learning and classical path planning methods.

### Strengths
- The authors combine a lot of well-established ideas and apply them to the problem of interest - multi-scale egocentric maps, frontier encoding, along with the intuitive total variation term in the reward. The impact of these elements is clearly demonstrated.
- Experiments across different 2D environments demonstrate general applicability of the learned policy and the performance seems to exceed the baselines that include classical methods and learning-based methods. The analysis is thorough with ablation studies of different components including observation representations, rewards, and architectures.
- The paper is well-written and organized, and clearly motivates different concepts before getting to the solution approach. The notation is consistent and clear throughout the paper and the figures are informative (with one exception, see weaknesses). Great job with the writing!

### Weaknesses
 - The details of the agent architecture and the reasoning behind the design choices isn’t completely clear - is there a reason for selecting SAC over other RL algorithms? What was the motivation behind the MLP architecture as a baseline when it’s not the best choice of the input representations at hand? Figure 4 is a bit confusing too - I thought multi-scale frontier maps M_f are a par t of the observation too but the illustration in Fig 4 don’t seem to mention that. Also, it wasn’t super clear at first glance what x3 or x4 meant in the architecture.
- I am not sure how practical the proposed approach is in real-world deployments - at the end of the day, the goal is to be able to deploy learned policies on real-systems. However, perfect observations for building global coverage/obstacle map and noise-free position/pose information are fairly strong assumptions that might limit practical utility. I do acknowledge the experiments with added Gaussian noise, but the scale of the noise isn’t completely clear and it seems like noise was only added to position information. I would have loved to see some real-world experiments or experiments on high-fidelity simulators with some discussion on inference speed/real-time performance.
- While I understand the work emphasizes on coverage path planning, I would have expected some discussion/experiments on the extent of collisions too - collisions matter in real-world problems, and unlike classical methods, the extent of collisions in a learned policy would at the end of the day depend on the relative weight of the collision-avoidance reward. It would be interesting to see the trade-off in the performance with more emphasis on collision avoidance when compared to classical approaches (to be clear, I am not recommending new experiments here - but it would be great if authors could discuss this aspect/share more details if they have the necessary information in the logs of existing runs).

### Questions
In addition to the questions in the weaknesses section, I have the following questions/suggestions:

- The word “environment dynamics” the the text is confusing - I understand what the authors wanted to convey but at the end of the day it’s agent dynamics.
- There are some issues with the notation in the POMDP definition. The state is Markovian by definition, and probability of transitioning to s_t should only depend on the previous state and action. If the problem formulation requires violating this, mention it explicitly.
- Did you experiment with any other reward formulations besides coverage area and total variation?
- How does the performance scale to much larger environments? At some point the multi-scale representation may need higher resolution or more scales, right?
- What’s the inference time like say on a standard laptop?

### Summary
The paper presents an end-to-end reinforcement learning approach to solve the problem of online coverage path planning. In particular, the paper formulates the problem as a Markov Decision Process, where the action space is continuous (linear and angular velocity), the observation space includes a multi-scale map representation, and the reward function includes a total variation term to incentivize the agent not to leave any unexplored part behind. The evaluation and comparison are performed on a number of different environments and with respect to some classic and learning-based methods. The code is included.

### Strengths
- Overall, the paper presents an RL based end-to-end method able to have the agent explore different unseen environments, providing an interesting view on the representation needed to achieve such a task.

- with a standard RL problem formulation, the proposed method includes elements that are not present in the current learning-based methods, such as including continuous action space.

- the presentation overall is clear, with a logical structure and justifications included in the different choices.

### Weaknesses
 - the paper provides as motivation with respect to classic methods "As these classical approaches cannot adapt to non-modeled environment dynamics, we turn to learning-based approaches", however, also the proposed method does not include any environment dynamics (the paper includes some examples in the introduction, such as damaged sensor or actuator). The paper currently lacks the corresponding gap from the classic methods and does not address the issue mentioned.

- while the paper includes a number of different methods for comparison, there are some methods that are not discussed at all, but that however would be relevant to discuss, in particular some learning-based methods that are predicting the structure of the environments, such as 

Caley, Jeffrey A., Nicholas RJ Lawrance, and Geoffrey A. Hollinger. "Deep learning of structured environments for robot search." Autonomous Robots 43 (2019): 1695-1714.

Shrestha, Rakesh, Fei-Peng Tian, Wei Feng, Ping Tan, and Richard Vaughan. "Learned map prediction for enhanced mobile robot exploration." In 2019 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 1197-1204. IEEE, 2019.

Arguably, compared to classic methods, a learning based approach can potentially learn some patterns to choose locations that are promising in terms of new information.

- there are parts that are not fully realistic, in particular the noise that would be present in the partial maps built by the robot, which has the effect of potentially guiding the robot towards areas that do not require exploration. It would be instead good to actually have the map built considering the noise. This can be achieved by using a realistic robot simulator with the perception/navigation stack already existing, e.g., in ROS.

- it is also not clear why different methods are used for comparison in the omnidirectional and non-omnidirectional case, especially for the classic methods. Classic methods typically separate the high level decision and planning to the low-level control, so the same methods can be applied.

- to appreciate the difference between methods, it is important to include also the standard deviation, i.e., in Table I. It would have been good to include coverage over time also for the omnidirectional case, in the appendix.

- the multiscale component plays a role given the fixed w and h for the map, however, it is not clear the difference in performance between a multi-scale approach vs if those w and h would be high enough to capture the environment at enough fine resolution. It would be interesting to see such a difference. In addition, there might be environments where one scale is enough, while other complex environments require more than one scale. It would be interesting to discuss such a difference in different environments, thus hinting an adaptive scale, and how in practice an adaptive scale can be included, as the training will happen with specific scales.

- a comment should be included about the impact of normalizing the distance measurements with respect to the maximum range, in particular about the generalization of the learned policy on a robot with different sensor range.

- it is good to provide an intuition on how to set the parameters

Just some minor presentation comments to fix:
- "in (1)" -> "in Eq. (1)"
- it can make sense to change CPP to exploration, given that in the end the coverage, for example in the lawn mowing task, has quite some difference in performance.

### Questions
- what is the standard deviation of the results in Table I? in other words, are the differences statistically significant?

- please include results with the same methods for both omnidirectional and non-omnidirectional case.

### Summary
This work proposes and investigates the effectiveness of a deep RL method for coverage path planning, with lawn mowing and exploration as practical example tasks. While the ultimate objective is total area covered, the authors proposes an additional total variation objective which minimizes the perimeter of explored areas to encourage coherent exploration, in addition to other collision objectives. The observation consists of multi-scaled and ego-centric maps of areas explored as well as frontiers, while the action space is the continuous speed and angular velocity of the agent. The authors trains the agent on a set of generated maps and evaluates on similar maps and additional maps from Explore-Bench. Favorable performance is demonstrated compared to frontier-based heuristics and some RL approaches.

### Strengths
The proposed method seems relatively simple and intuitive from a learning perspective, which improves the chances that it might generalize beyond the paper. I have not been able to find previous works which are substantively similar, which speaks to the originality of the overall method and its application, even though individual components such as multi-scale observations, continuous actions, and reward shaping are not original by themselves. The clarity is good and the paper is easy to read. The experimental results are convincing compared to the baseline methods, and the experiments and ablations are appropriately designed.

### Weaknesses
My main concern is that the baselines may not be challenging enough. Intuitively, I agree on the focus on frontier-based baselines, but there should be a traveling salesman (TSP)-based baseline which aims to find a shortest path among the frontier points with a state-of-the-art TSP solver like Concorde, either in a discretized grid (converted into a graph) or in a probabilistic roadmap (PRM) graph. As mentioned in the survey below, TSP is a common technique applicable in coverage path problems.

The RL-based baseline (Hu 2020) targets a multi-agent setting and is a simple feed-forward policy with no convolutional architecture, and it’s not clear if this is a fair comparison.

Overall, there is very little detail on how the baselines are implemented in this work; many of the baselines are originally proposed in multi-agent settings rather than single-agent settings. It’s difficult to judge how non-trivial the baselines are, and intuitively there should be a TSP-based or other combinatorial optimization-based baseline, given that CPP is a combinatorial problem. While the paper presents strong results relative to the given baselines, the baselines themselves have to be appropriately designed.

Minor:
I think the total variation contribution is slightly over-claimed, as the total variation is simply the perimeter of the explored area. While this shaping term is interesting and useful, using “total variation” to describe this reward makes the paper less clear and does not provide additional insights / intuition.

### Questions
I see the collision penalty in the objective term. Does the agent collide at all with obstacles? If so, I would like to see the frequency of collision of the different approaches.
