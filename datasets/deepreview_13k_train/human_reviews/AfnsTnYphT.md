- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 6, 8, 8

## Abstract
Vision tasks are characterized by the properties of locality and translation invariance. 
    The superior performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on these tasks is widely attributed to the inductive bias of locality and weight sharing baked into their architecture.
    Existing attempts to quantify the statistical benefits of these biases in CNNs over locally connected convolutional neural networks (LCNs) and fully connected neural networks (FCNs) fall into one of the following categories: either they disregard the optimizer and only provide uniform convergence upper bounds with no separating lower bounds, 
    or they consider simplistic tasks that do not truly mirror the locality and translation invariance as found in real-world vision tasks.
    To address these deficiencies, we introduce the Dynamic Signal Distribution (DSD) classification task that models an image as consisting of $k$ patches, each of dimension $d$, and the label is determined by a $d$-sparse signal vector that can freely appear in any one of the $k$ patches. 
    On this task, for any orthogonally equivariant algorithm like gradient descent, we prove that CNNs require $\tilde{O}(k+d)$ samples, whereas LCNs require $\Omega(kd)$ samples, establishing the statistical advantages of weight sharing in translation invariant tasks. 
    Furthermore, LCNs need $\tilde{O}(k(k+d))$ samples, compared to $\Omega(k^2d)$ samples for FCNs, showcasing the benefits of locality in local tasks.
    Additionally, we develop information theoretic tools for analyzing randomized algorithms, which may be of interest for statistical research.

### Summary
This work provides a theoretical analysis of the sample complexity of Convolutional Networks (CNNs), Local Connected Networks (LCNs), and Fully-Connected Networks (FCNs). This paper claims that CNNs are more sample efficient than LCNs, which in turn are more sample efficient than FCNs when the data has implicit locality and translation invariance properties, as is the case with visual data. The authors prove lower bounds on the sample complexity of FCNs and LCNs, and similarly demonstrate upper bounds on the sample complexities of LCNs and CNNs to draw firm conclusions under the assumptions made in their theory.

To carry out the analysis, the paper proposed a toy data model inspired from the concepts of locality and translation invariance in natural images, called the Dynamic Signal Distribution (DSD) task. Here the input is comprised of k consecutive patches of dimension d, and one of the k patches is randomly filled with a noisy signed signal, while remaining patches are filled with isotropic Gaussian noise. A binary label for the input is determined from the sign of the signal.

### Strengths
### Significance
* While the results agree with empirical intuition that inductive biases in the model reflecting properties of the data should improve sample complexity, it is interesting to see such a result made crisp for vision models, and with specific focus on the locality and translation invariance properties of visual data.

### Clarity
* The analysis is non-trivial and requires heavy notation; the paper does a good job at walking the reader through the intuition, proofs, claims, and findings, however much of the theoretical development is relegated to the appendix.

### Originality
* The authors theoretical analysis is quite unique in my opinion. To the best of my knowledge, the proposed DSD model is novel, and the derived lower bounds are enabled by taking the learning algorithm (gradient descent) into account. This is necessary since a learning algorithm can simulate CNNs with LCNs and FCNs. While previous works have established a sample complexity separation when assuming training with gradient descent, they used a data model which did not seek to capture translation invariance and locality.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness in my opinion is step connecting the theoretical findings to practice. Given the theoretical contribution, I do not expect an in-depth empirical analysis with deep networks; however, I would to see numerical results demonstrating the derived theory under the DSD model. It is fine to constrain to single hidden layer networks as is done in the theory.

** Minor point, but in notation it is stated that vectors are indexed at 1, but on page 4, $\mu_i[(i-1)d:id]$ is indexed at 0.

### Questions
Please provide numerical experiments with synthetic data under the DSD model and one-layer CNNs, LCNs, and FCNs, and examine the empirical sample complexity of this model as you vary the quantities of interest ($\sigma$, $k$, $d$).

### Summary
The authors proof that CNNs has a better sample complexity than LCNs, and LCNs has a better sample complexity than FCNs under the framework of Dynamic Signal Distribution.

### Strengths
Theoretical proof is provided regarding the sample complexity of FCNs, LCNs, and CNNs. The theoretical proof is built upon several tools like Dynamic Signal Distribution (DSD), network architectures given DSD, equivariant algorithms, minimax risk, etc. Overall speaking, the paper is well-organized and easy to follow even for general audience.

### Weaknesses
1. The Local Signal Adaptivity (LSA) activation function is quite different compared to popular used activation function, like ReLU or more recent activation function. A better justification of using LSA could be provided. 
2. From the proof sketch in section 6 and section 7, it seems that the sample complexity is dependent on what is the learning setting. For example, in section 6, 'we establish that learning U ◦ DSD with m samples requires learning k "nearly independent" subtasks,' and in section 7, 'we establish that learning U ◦ DSD with m samples requires learning k independent subtasks.' Dose this result in the difference between the sample complexity of LCNs in section 6 and 7? If this is the case, I think authors could add more analysis regarding how the results will change given the learning setting of 'U ◦ DSD', In addition, is there a setting where the sample complexity of FCNs, LCNs and CNNs is similar? I hope authors could provide more insights regarding this.

### Questions
Can the current framework support ReLU like activation functions?

### Summary
The authors study the problem of sample complexity for different classes of models based on analyzing an equivariant gradient descent type algorithm.

### Strengths
- The relation between sample complexity and the type of network is interesting.
- There seems to be real improvements over previous works.

### Weaknesses
The only downside I see to this work is the fact that there is no empirical result which supports the theoretic result. I myself cannot find any issue or criticism with the theory that was presented, but the complexity and abtractness of the setting and the numerous variables involved makes it difficult to find any error in the derivation if one exists.

Therefore, it seems that there needs to be some empirical result of the predicted complexity and an actual observation rather than just a standalone theory with no phyisical evidence to support it. It seems that the problem setup is precise enough to run small experiments on the linear models outlined in section 4.2. 

For example, for a fixed amount of $sigma$ and $d$, each linear model can be trained on an increasing number of classes to show the empirical observation of the $k$ term. Similarly, this can also be shown with a fixed $sigma$ and $k$. This is just the first example of what came to mind, but the authors may indeed be able to come up with an even better experiment given their study of the problem.

If this can be added, I would be happy to raise my score. 

## Minor:

After the conclusion, there is a QED symbol which is likely a typo and should have appeared after the previous section.

### Questions
- I am curious if transformers can be described by FCN or LCN, or if they need a totally different treatment. I think this would be an interesting discussion point to add if there is any insight because the sample complexity for transformers is a relevant and interesting topic.

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
In this research, they investigate the superior performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in vision-centric tasks in comparison to Locally Connected Networks (LCNs) and Fully Connected Networks (FCNs). They introduce the concept of Dynamic Signal Distribution (DSD), an intricate data model devised to encapsulate inherent properties observed in real-world imagery, notably locality and translation invariance. Within the framework of this study, they establish a theoretical sample complexity separation between CNNs, LCNs, and FCNs, taking into account optimization considerations.

### Strengths
This paper is well-written and provides very supportive technical details. The authors introduce an interesting data model called DSD to represent real-world vision tasks. This task is straightforward and simple, making it suitable for theoretical analysis. Additionally, this task exhibits characteristics of locality and translation invariance.

### Weaknesses
Primary Concerns:

Novelty. My main reservation pertains to the novelty made over the work by Wang & Wu (2023). While I concede that the task depicted here is more realistic than that in Wang & Wu (2023), it appears the core insights remain consistent: FCNs are equivalent to global rotation groups, whereas LCNs relate to local rotation/permutation groups. Although the authors consider optimization in the upper bound analysis for LCNs and CNNs, the chosen algorithm, which has just two training iterations, seems quite unconventional and perhaps too simplistic. I'm uncertain whether this presents an improvement relative to the ERM analysis. Regarding the lower bound section, if I interpret it correctly, does the novelty lie mostly in the technical novelty? It appears that the primary objective is to determine the size of the enlarged function class, when the original task is enlarged by the global/local rotation group. I question the significance of the specific method used for this calculation. My primary concern remains to be the novelty over Wang & Wu (2023). If clarity on this point is provided, I'm inclined to upgrade my rating to at least 6. Moreover, it would be beneficial if the paper could elaborate more on the contributions of Wang & Wu (2023) and comparisons with Wang & Wu (2023). For instance, when stating on page 2, "Wang & Wu (2023) extended this line of work to show a separation between FCNs, LCNs and CNNs. However, that work suffer from the same drawbacks as Li et al. (2021).", a more explicit discussion on the advancements and remaining problems in Wang & Wu (2023) would be useful.

Secondary Concerns:

1. Regarding the model definitions, what is the reason for limiting the norm of $w_i$ to less than one? This seems implausible.
2. What necessitates the width of your FCN models to be defined as $k$? Shouldn't the lower bound be applicable to any width, at least intuitively?
3. Concerning the proof outline for theorem 6.1, in its first step, could there be an inclusion of a more comprehensive technical elaboration? While some readers might be able to grasp its logic intuitively, offering a detailed technical justification, especially given its novel approach, would be beneficial.
