## Abstract
In this paper, we present a refined study of learning rate schedules for stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In contrast to most prior works that study the convergence of the average iterate, we study the last iterate, which is what most people use in practice. Furthermore, we break away from the tradition of replacing the gradients with crude upper bounds, which allows us to obtain a \emph{problem-adaptive} learning rate schedule. Our method is the first systematic approach to \emph{automatically} yield learning rate warm-up and rapid learning rate annealing near the end of training. In cases where gradient norm information is not available, our theory predicts that the best choice is the linear-decay schedule that sets the stepsize proportionally to $1 - t/T$, where $t$ is the current iteration and $T$ is the total number of steps. Our final theoretical result is an extension of our methodology to coordinate-wise methods. We perform the most comprehensive evaluation of learning rate schedules to date, evaluating across 10 diverse deep learning problems, a series of LLMs, and a suite of logistic regression problems. We validate that overall, the linear-decay schedule outperforms all commonly used default schedules including cosine annealing, and that our schedule refinement method gives further improvements.

### Summary
This paper presents a refined study of learning rate scheduling for last iterate convergence of stochastic gradient methods. This automatically yields warmup and annealing schedules, and predicts a linear decay when gradient information is unavailable. The paper also presents an extension to co-ordinate wise methods and supplements this with empirical studies on many deep learning benchmarks including LLMs. Interestingly, this paper presents a learning rate scheduling scheme for any no-regret learning method into one that offers a last iterate convergence guarantee.

### Strengths
- A very refined characterization of learning rate scheduling that captures various nuances relating to warmup, annealing etc. It recovers several practically effective heuristics that have lacked theoretical support in prior works.
- A reasonably thorough treatment of empirical benchmarking with many deep learning problems of interest.

### Weaknesses
The paper's writing can be made clearer about notions of anytime optimality versus developing schemes that work assuming a known end time (as is done in this paper), and what are the challenges in developing an algorithm for the unknown end time case?

### Questions
- What sequence of learning rates obtain optimal rates in terms of gradient norm? Can this potentially address the limitation mentioned at the end of this paper?
- Can the authors comment on whether one can utilize the doubling trick (Hazan and Kale 2014) to make progress on the unknown end time case?
- Another popular heuristic in practice (and in theory) is that of batch size doubling. Can the authors comment on how (or whether) these results can be connected with how to set batch sizes in practice?

### Summary
This paper delivers an advanced examination of learning rate schedules in the context of stochastic gradient descent. The authors depart from conventional techniques and introduce a novel approach to derive a problem-adaptive learning rate schedule. Furthermore, the paper conducts an extensive evaluation of learning rate schedules, establishing that their schedule refinement technique yields further enhancements.

### Strengths
1. The authors offer a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the problem-adaptive learning rate schedule, providing detailed insights into its workings.

2. The authors conduct an extensive evaluation of learning rate schedules, directly comparing classical and modern schedules. Their findings reveal a clear hierarchy among these schedules, offering valuable insights into their relative effectiveness.

### Weaknesses
1. One limitation of this paper is the absence of theoretical analysis in non-convex settings, which is particularly relevant in deep learning problems.

2. From a theoretical perspective, it is not evident how the proposed method outperforms other classical learning rate schedules. Clarifying the advantages of this approach in comparison to traditional methods is essential for a comprehensive understanding of its efficacy.

### Questions
1.Regarding the deep learning experiments:
1.1. It's not explicitly mentioned whether GPT, RoBERTa, and ViT train from scratch. Additional details on the training process would be beneficial.
1.2. Table 4 indicates that after an extended training period (epochs=30), the cosine learning rate schedule yields superior results compared to the linear decay schedule. It's a valid inquiry to explore whether, with even longer training, the same pattern might emerge for GPT and RoBERTa training—i.e., whether cosine decay becomes more advantageous.
1.3. It would be valuable to clarify whether the learning rate scheduling method labeled 'Cosine' refers to the classic cosine decay or cosineannealing learning rate schedule.

2.Adagrad is known to perform well under convex settings and has strong theoretical support in such scenarios. . However, it is crucial to investigate whether this paper demonstrates that the proposed method surpasses Adagrad, both theoretically and empirically. Further elaboration, as well as empirical comparisons, would be required to draw a definitive conclusion in this regard.

3.Can Theorem 8 be applied to the LAMB optimizer?

### Summary
This paper investigates the learning rate schedules for SGD and study the convergence of the last iteration. The proposed method achieves a problem-adaptive learning rate schedule without using the crude constant bounds on the gradient norms, and proved to be effective via numerical experiments.

### Strengths
1. This paper investigates the last iteration convergence for SGD and shows that the best choice is the linear decay schedule. This finding is also validated by solid numerical experiments. Overall, the authors present interesting results in this paper.
2. This paper is well-organized and easy for readers to follow. The proofs in the paper seem correct to me.

### Weaknesses
1. The contribution of this paper is limited. The $\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}$ convergence is not new, and it would be better if the authors could highlight the difference (novelty) and the challenge in the analysis of this paper.

2. The statement that the best strategy is the linear decay schedule seems not to be well supported. Although in the author's analysis, the proposed method can be reduced to the decay, it cannot theoretically prove that it is better than other methods.

### Summary
The paper proposes a set of learning rate schedules in deep learning from convex optimization theory. The theory can partially explain the popular linear decay schedule and highlights the importance to decrease the learning rate at the ending phase of training. The paper also evaluates the performance of different learning rate schedules on an extensive set of experiments and supports the use of linear-decay learning rate schedules.

### Strengths
The paper proposes an interesting theoretical framework to explain the linear decay schedule in deep learning. The theory can also be used to build the learning rate schedule for not only SGD, but also element-wise algorithms like Adam. Numerically, the paper introduces a series of new techniques in algorithm 1 and 2, including median filter, $\ell_2$ norm inverse weighting, and $\ell_1$ norm inverse weighting.

### Weaknesses
1. The authors should emphasize that their theory is based on convex optimization. In theorem 3 and 8, the assumption that $f$ is a convex function should be clearly stated in the theorem statement.

2. For experiments in section 3.2, it is not very clear which algorithm is used for each experiment. For example, the paper mentions using ImageNet, RCNN, and CIFAR, but it is unclear whether these experiments use SGD with $\ell_2$ norm inverse weighting, or some other method. Similarly, for the other experiments, it is not explicitly stated whether they use Adam with $\ell_1$ norm inverse weighting. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to reproduce the results and fully understand the experimental setup.

3. Also, authors can provide more details about "a sweep of learning rates on a grid" for the refined schedule. It is not intuitive why we should sweep over any parameter in the refined schedule. Based on algorithm 1 or 2, the refined schedule does not contain any additional tuning parameter than $\tau$. The paper should provide a clear explanation of what parameters are being swept and the rationale behind this procedure.

### Questions
It seems that the schedule refinement requires two times computation resources than the standard linear decay or cosine schedule. Is there a way to improve that?

### Summary
This paper proposes a refined study of learning rate schedule for SGD. It presents last iterate convergence results. The proposed method automatically yields learning rate warm-up and rapid learning rate annealing near the end of training. The authors also conduct comprehensive numerical experiment to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.

### Strengths
This work proposes a novel refinement method, which uses a prior training run to produce an improved schedule to use in future runs. This method is guaranteed in a last iterate convergence fashion and can be generalized beyond SGD, which are more realistic.
Based on this method, a practical method is proposed. Comprehensive experiments validate the performance of the schedule refinement method.

### Weaknesses
The theory appears to be more of a heuristic that doesn't directly address practical implementation.
Some places need further clarifications.

### Questions
1.  In Figure 1, how do you define warm-up? Why the refined schedule starts from nearly zero? Does this lead to slow update at the beginning? Is there any way this can be improved?
2. In the analysis of Th 3, $w_t$ and $g_t$ are assumed to be conditionally independent. Based on that, equation (2) presents a last iteration problem-dependent regret bound. However, the chosen $w_t$ does not satisfy the independent assumption, which means equation (2) does not hold. How you argue this setting of $w_t$ still minimizes the bound?  What is the impact here? 
3. What is the definition of median_filter? How it ensures the gradient norm sequence does not change significantly after refinement?
4. It seems that the theory is weak, only useful in a heuristic way. What is the novelty in your proof?
 In addition, it is restricted to convex functions. How about cases of non-convex functions under further assumptions?
