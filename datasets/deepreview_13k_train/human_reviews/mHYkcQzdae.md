- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 5, 3

## Abstract
Micro-expression (ME) is a kind of facial expression that is short-lived and difficult for ordinary people to detect. Micro-expression can reflect the real emotion that people try to hide. It is difficult to identify micro-expression due to the fact that the duration is short and it only involves partial muscle motions, which brings great challenges to the accurate identification of micro-expression. To address these issues, we propose a novel neural network for micro-expression recognition (MER), focusing on subtle changes in facial movements using a CVA (Continuously Vertical Attention) block, which models the local muscle changes with minimal identity information. Additionally, we propose a facial position localization module called FPF (Facial Position Focalizer) based on Swin Transformer, which incorporates spatial information into the facial muscle movement pattern features used for MER. We also proved that including AU (Action Units) can further enhance accuracy, and therefore we have incorporated AU information to assist in micro-expression recognition. The experimental results indicate that the model achieved an average recognition accuracy of 94.35\% and 86.76\% on the popular CASME II and SAMM micro-expression datasets, improved by 6\% and 1.98\% compared to state-of-the-art models, respectively.

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The presented work proposes a neural network addressing micro-expression recognition task. The method utilizes  a multi branch approach, extracting motion patterns from the difference between the onset frame and the apex frame and generates facial features  incorporating facial position information using Swin Transformer. Features representing facial feature movements are enhanced using Continuous Vertical Attention Module. The method is validated on two public datasets and the ablation study is performed for evaluation of each introduced block.

### Strengths
1. The related work section is comprehensive, clearly introducing previous solutions and listing their limitations
2. The performed ablation study covers all introduced blocks showing their relevance to the MER task.
3. The selection of Swin Transformer is justified in the presented experiments, showing its advantage over the ViT and supporting the claim that the shift window mechanism is crucial for capturing long-distance dependencies.

### Weaknesses
1. The novelty of the proposed model is limited. The method is very similar to MMNet that also uses two branches, apex and onset frame difference as the input to the motion pattern block, Continuous Attention module and the mechanism for position calibration, which is slightly different but serves similar purpose. 
2. Figure 2a CA module looks different than the CA module presented in the original MMNet work. In fact, the CA module in the MMNet work closely resembles the proposed CVA module presented in Fig. 2b. The math for the CA ad CVA modules is also very similar, indicating high similarity between both blocks. The only difference seems to be in the use of the vertical direction only.
3. Results for 3 classes should be also provided to ensure detailed comparison with previous methods.

### Questions
1. What would be the gain in using detailed annotation of AU instead of just binary information?
2. Are you planning to make the implementation publicly available? 
3. Please provide visualization of attention maps to show that the method pays attention to micro expressions. Have you performed such analysis? 
4. Were all methods retrained in the same way, using the LOSO cross-validation method?

### Summary
The authors propose a pipeline for micro-expression recognition (MER), which are brief facial expressions often challenging to identify due to their short duration and partial muscle movements. Their approach includes a Continuously Vertical Attention (CVA) block to capture subtle facial muscle changes without focusing on identity information and a Facial Position Focalizer (FPF) module based on the Swin Transformer. The authors also integrated  Action Units (AU) information into the pipeline to enhance accuracy. Their experiments show that the proposed model achieved significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art techniques for microexpression recognition. Further ablation studies signified using CVA, FPF and action unit information.

### Strengths
The authors attributed the novelty of the work to the use of a vertical attention module, a facial position focalizer using a Swin transformer and the use of AU embeddings to focus on active facial regions due to muscle activations. The modules were integrated into a dual-stream network to recognize microexpressions. The proposed ensemble was trained and validated on CASMEII  and SAMM datasets.

The proposed pipeline is novel, introducing a vertical attention module. However, the use of difference images and Swin transformer to extract feature representations and AU integration for embeddings are existing mechanisms in literature. Their integration with VAC does bring in an aspect of extended feature representation that is beneficial for better recognition accuracies.

### Weaknesses
The authors highlight the significant contribution of facial muscles in the vertical direction and other submodules for identifying microexpressions. However, the authors needed to substantiate this understanding within the experimental setup. The increase in accuracy and F1 score, is it statistically significant? Were these results cross-validated, and if so, what is the expected deviation from the reported results? 

It also needs to be clarified whether the authors handled bias in the labels for the reported results. This information would be crucial to validate the results reported.

It would be beneficial to generate heat maps for the test samples to understand the areas of significance utilized by the pipeline for prediction purposes. This information may be included in the Appendix if necessary.

### Questions
1. Will the reported results change for vertical attention vs horizontal attention vs combined if the bias (if any) was handled? What was the size and distribution of the test set?

2. Is the difference in reported results significant? 

3. If yes, what is the expected deviation from the mean during multiple folds of the training and testing?

### Summary
The authors propose a micro facial expression recognition framework that includes preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. They propose a continuous vertical attention module that aims at local muscle movements and a facial position localizer that focuses on spatial information. They also included AUs for better information. Experiments are performed on CASME II and SAMM datasets and compared with previous methods.

### Strengths
The paper targets an important issue of micro facial expression recognition. It is well-written step by step and easy to follow. The encoding of vertical facial muscle movement is interesting. Multiple ablations were conducted to show the importance of each component. The proposed method gets better accuracy on two datasets.

### Weaknesses
The paper uses extra information( apex, onset frames and AUs) and in experiments, it is not clearly mentioned which previous work uses that information. My detailed comments and questions are as follow.
1> Apex frame and onset frame are used to extract information about microexpression. Extracting these frames from a sequence of frames is itself a task. How do you compare your work with other methods that use whole sequences?
2> AUs reveal a lot of information about expression. Getting AU information from images is again a challenging task. Authors are using directly available AUs in their method. How do you compare your method with other works that are using this readily available information?
3> This work subtracts two frames for difference information. Did the authors encounter a situation where two frames are not aligned perfectly? Will it affect the further process and How do you encounter that?
4> Since this work targets the removal of identity information, it will be better to mention papers that also target identity removal. (if possible experimental comparison too)
5>How do the authors justify that vertical facial muscle movements are more important than horizontal ones (other than experiments)?
6? In section 3.3 authors mention ‘lenght’ 21 2D vector. What do you mean by length in a 2D vector?
7> Is it possible to give some visuals of the vertical attention module?
8>There are multiple space and dot errors in the paper. Please proofread carefully.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper deals with the micro-expression recognition problem. It proposes a Continuously Vertical Attention (CVA) block to model the local muscle changes excluding the identity information. It proposes a Facial Position Focalize (FPF) module to incorporate spatial information and also utilizes AU information to further improve performance. Experiments on two micro-expression datasets validate that the proposed method achieves superior performance than other models.

### Strengths
1. The motivation of the proposed method is reasonable. It proposes a CVA block to model the continuous local muscle changes.

2. The paper is easy to follow and the proposed method is easy to understand.

3. Experiments on two datasets show that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy and F1-score compared with other methods.

### Weaknesses
1. The novelty is limited. As far as I'm concerned, the continuous attention block and position calibration module are both proposed in the MMNet paper. It also utilizes the subtraction between the apex and onset to determine the local movement of muscles. Thus, the difference between this work and the previous work lies in that this paper uses vertical attention instead of both directions, which is not quite novel.

2. This paper does not contain any visualization results. For example, what is the difference between vertical attention and both directions regards the attention maps? What are the feature distributions before and after using the AU information?

3. Experiments on other datasets and other metrics are required. For example, MMNet also carried out experiments on the MMEW dataset. Furthermore, in paper [1], it carried out experiments on CASME3 and SMIC datasets. The performance of the two datasets is not enough to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the micro-expression recognition field. The authors should consider using the metrics of UF1 and UAR to make fair comparisons with the paper [1].

### Questions
1. Why using vertical attention instead of both-direction attention could improve the performance? Is there any justice or similar phenomenon in other papers? To me, using vertical attention means some information in the horizontal direction is lost.

2. In Table 2, It seems to me the most improvement of the performance is brought by the AU Embedding. What is the performance using CVA block + FPF block without AU Embedding? The last column has a typo, embeddir should be embedding.
