# Always-Sparse Training with Guided Stochastic Exploration

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 3, 3

## Abstract
The excessive computational requirements of modern artificial neural networks (ANNs) are posing limitations on the machines that can run them. Sparsification of ANNs is often motivated by time, memory and energy savings only during model inference, yielding no benefits during training. A growing body of work is now focusing on providing the benefits of model sparsification also during training. While these methods greatly improve the training efficiency, the training algorithms yielding the most accurate models still materialize the dense weights, or compute dense gradients during training. We propose an efficient, always-sparse training algorithm which improves the accuracy over previous methods. Additionally, our method has excellent scaling to larger and sparser models, supported by its linear time complexity with respect to the model width during training and inference. We evaluate our method on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet using ResNet, VGG, and ViT models, and compare it against a range of sparsification methods.

### Summary
This paper revises the growth criteria within sparse training algorithms employing a prune-and-grow approach. Their primary objective is to prevent the regrowth of pruned weights by confining candidate weights exclusively to those that were not just pruned. Moreover, they impose additional restrictions by selecting candidate weights as a subset through random sampling based on specific distributions. The authors proceed to perform experiments across various datasets and with different backbone models, leading to some improvements in the results.

### Strengths
The experiments encompass a variety of datasets, such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, while utilizing different backbone architectures like ResNet, ViT, and VGG. Furthermore, they conduct extensive comparisons with numerous baseline methods.

### Weaknesses
1. Lack of novelty

1.1 The novel insights presented in this paper are quite limited. Essentially, the proposed approach involves initially selecting a candidate subset from the weights that were not pruned, followed by weight selection based on existing criteria. Importantly, the same pruning and growth criteria are retained from previous methods.

1.2 Regarding the distribution methods employed for sampling, the use of gradient-based distributions appears to contradict the proposed efficiency enhancement. This is because these distributions also require the computation of the full gradient, resulting in a complexity that is identical to RigL [1]. Furthermore, these distributions do not yield any performance improvements over RigL [1], indicating their relatively inconsequential role in this study.

2. Marginal improvements

The improvements observed in the results are rather modest, typically falling within the range of 0.1% to 0.5%, thus demonstrating limited practical significance.

### Questions
If the size of the candidate weights were to expand to encompass all weights, the performance should theoretically match that of RigL. However, Figure 2 in the current presentation only illustrates the scenario where the maximum value of $\gamma$ is set to 2. It would be insightful to have a comprehensive plot that covers a broader range of $\gamma$ values. The existing experimental results seem to suggest that a $\gamma$ value of 1 outperforms RigL (where $\gamma$ approaches infinity). It would be valuable to discern at what point the performance begins to decline for specific $\gamma$ values and provide an explanatory analysis in this regard.

### Summary
This work proposes a method of always sparse training that doesn’t require materialization of full dense weight and gradient matrices at any training step. Sparsity distribution for each layer is induced based on the activation and gradients of a given layer. The approach is validated on a couple of vision tasks and architectures.

### Strengths
The approach for search of pruned/active connections as well as sparsity distributions make sense. The method manages to match or even outperform the baseline RigL method in a couple of scenarios.

### Weaknesses
The contribution of the work seems to be largely incremental. Introduced **GSE** is based on RigL and only augments it with a connection sampling strategy and use of sparse gradient for determination of the new active connections.

While the value proposition of the method is the training of large-scale models that cannot fit onto consumer or high-end GPU, experiments in this work are done at small scale, amenable to researchers and practitioners with limited compute power. The potential advantage of the method could be in reduction of the FLOPs for backward pass, but the baseline RigL requires materialization of dense gradient only on update steps, done typically every 100–1000 steps. Thus, the computational savings are minor.  At this scale, a method allowing for higher exploration of sparsity masks is likely to get better performance [1], [2] for a given target sparsity and training time.

Some more recent works with always sparse training managed to significantly outperform RigL. Powerpropagation+Top-KAST [3] and ITOP-RigL [4] have noticeably better 
numbers for 90% sparsity on ResNet-50 while adopting the same training procedure.

*Minor*.  Notation for $f^{[l]}$, $g^{[l]}$ is confusing. $h_l$, $g_l$ - denote a scalar value - norm of the weights / gradients for a given layer, where $1$ is a vector of all ones with length - `(num_layers,)`. And there is expression in the denominator $1^T |h/g^{(l-1)}| 1$ that would imply, that 
$h^{(l)}$ is a matrix of size `(num_layers, num_layers)`. I think it would be better to write sum over $l$ in the denominator.

### Questions
How is the norm of activations / gradient computed? Does one sum all elements in a tensor and take the absolute value, or computes L1, L2 norm. The first approach would yield zero in expectation for symmetric distributions and may not reflect presence of large elements in activation/gradient tensor, whereas the latter two yield the same value after multiplication by sign.

### Summary
The paper presents an approach to apply a grow and prune approach to train an "always sparse" neural network. The paper presents how guided stochastic exploration can be used in a grow and prune approach to train an always sparse neural network with some amount of empirical performance. The paper presents an approach to do guided stochastic exploration using subset sampling, wrapped in the overall "cosine decay" strategy of decision making. The cosine decay strategy is well known for having some form of, "explore-exploit," baked in. Empirical validation and comparisons to related work in the field is presented. Some vague connections to actual neural networks in human brains is hinted at.

### Strengths
The authors have presented a well written and understandable argument for their paper to be accepted.

### Weaknesses
The paper delivers no actual empirical results useful in practice. As deep learning is a practical and engineering field, it is not really known what is the value of showing improvements in big-O format, when actual implementation of these approaches are in super huge networks such as ChatGPT, GPT4, Diffusion Models, and many other productionized models. There are open source minified models of the above as well that can be run on a desktop or a laptop. The reviewer believes that there are no practical benefits of this approach in that setting either.

If the paper should be acceptable as a theoretical work due to the potential of its' contributions being useful in the future, then the authors have not shown sufficient novelty compared to the many other related works that are cited within the work. The technical tools used to deliver improvements are rather well known with obvious applications to this problem. If the paper is meant to be in a theoretical setting, what model of computation should be used to analyze its claims?

The paper does not consider over wall-clock time analysis in any of its thinking. If the procedure itself of guided stochastic exploration takes longer than the theoretical speedup in FLOPs gained by the sparsifying, then, then any benefits of the proposed approach is moot.

The paper considers sparsifying weight connections, it is well known that this cannot, in practice, deliver any actual improvement on massively parallel SIMD architectures used in deep learning today. Sparse general matrix-matrix multiplies are known to be, more or less, impossible to speed up in SIMD setting where the actual observed wall-clock time speedup is anywhere close to the theoretical speedup indicated by FLOP reduction. There are several peer reviewed works exploring this problem.

The connection between artificial neural networks and actual neural networks in the brains of living creatures is not well thought out, I will cover this in more detail in the "Questions" section of the review.

### Questions
What do the authors believe is a reasonable path to move this paper towards some form of acceptance given the above concerns?

If the purpose of this paper is to reason or advance the field of "biologically plausible neural networks" that may have applications to neuroscience, could the authors cite why this paper would be valuable to the neuroscience community? Could the authors make that argument iron-tight and clear before it is considered under the peer review setting?

If the purpose of this paper is to connect the field of Artificial Neural Networks with "biological neural networks" in brains of living creatures, could the author expound on this greatly? One place to start would be how actual neurons in actual brains having spiking activity called spike trains, and don't behave much like artificial neural networks at all. Spiking neural networks are also a good place to start on this path.

If it is the case that this paper is an exploratory, prototyping work for some other future work based on the findings of this research work, do the authors believe that it is sufficient to meet the bar for peer review?
