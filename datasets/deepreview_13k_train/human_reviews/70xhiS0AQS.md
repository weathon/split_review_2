# TaskBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Task Automation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 5, 3

## Abstract
In recent years, the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) has sparked interest in task automation, which involves decomposing complex tasks described by user instructions into sub-tasks and invoking external tools to execute them, playing a central role in autonomous agents. However, there is a lack of systematic and standardized benchmarks to promote the development of LLMs in task automation. To address this, we introduce \textsc{TaskBench}, a comprehensive framework to evaluate the capability of LLMs in task automation. Specifically, task automation can be divided into three critical stages: task decomposition, tool selection, and parameter prediction.
To tackle the complexities inherent in these stages, we introduce the concept of Tool Graph to represent decomposed tasks and adopt a back-instruct method to generate high-quality user instructions. We propose \textsc{TaskEval}, a multi-faceted evaluation methodology that assesses LLM performance across these three stages. Our approach combines automated construction with rigorous human verification, ensuring high consistency with human evaluation.
Experimental results demonstrate that \textsc{TaskBench} effectively reflects the capabilities of various LLMs in task automation. It provides insights into model performance across different task complexities and domains, pushing the boundaries of what current models can achieve.

### Summary
This work focuses on creating a benchmark that evaluates the task automation for large language models. A common practice is to formulate it into three critical stages, including task decomposition, tool invocation and parameter prediction.
The main contributions of the work are (1) The dataset creation, denoted as TaskBench, based on the aforementioned formulation. (2) Based on the created dataset, the performance of different aspects can be evaluated effectively and quantitatively.
For dataset creation, in details, to facilitate the dataset construction, the authors introduced the concept of Tool Graph to represent the connections/dependencies among the decomposed tasks. Three resources are leveraged for collecting tools, including the HuggingFace (e.g. Summarization), Multimedia (e.g. Text-to-Video), and Daily Life APIs (e.g. stock operation). 
With pre-defined tools, the authors formulate three patterns for tool invocation: Node, Chain, and DAG (directed acyclic graph). With the diverse sampled subgraphs, back-instruct method is used to inversely craft user instructions, task steps, and tool invocation graphs.
For task evaluation, different steps are evaluated. Rouge-* and bertScore are used for evaluating textual description in task decomposition. F1 is used for evaluating the tool invocation and tool parameter prediction.
Experimental results demonstrate the TaskBench can be effectively utilized to evaluate task automation ability of LLMs.

### Strengths
This work covers more diverse tools than some other related work. For example, ToolQA defined 13 tools, mainly for accessing external knowledge. In this work, the authors consider three tool resources including the huggingface, multimedia and daily life APIs, in total 103 tools. Furthermore, designing LLM-based critic and rule-based critic is great to evaluate the consistency of the generated tool invocation graphs with the sampled tool subgraphs, without too much human effort.
The experimental results are also interesting. In terms of zero-shot, the OpenAI model significantly outperforming the open-sourced LLM. But for few-shot setting, code-llama gets closer to the OpenAI models. To my understanding, this may indicate that the OpenAI models did pretty good SFT and RLHF, to make models understand the instructions/task better, which aligns with the finding from “In-Context Learning Creates Task Vectors”.

### Weaknesses
Although there is a section discussing the positive correlation of the proposed evaluation with human assessment and a section about using LLM and rule to check the alignment between the generated data and sampled tool sub-graph, in terms of data quality, it would be more insightful to show the quality measured by human. This will show the quality of the self-critic, either LLM-based critic or rule-based critic.
If the authors can provide more examples (predictions and gold answers) in appendix, it would be useful to help readers understand the difficulty of each tasks and some error cases/analysis in main text would be useful. Otherwise, the number itself cannot provide too much information regarding this dataset.
Comparing to the node prediction, the edge prediction is harder based on the evaluation results. What’s the error types for edge prediction? Does the model make equivalent edge prediction but different connectivity?

### Summary
The paper generates a tool usage dataset for evaluating LLM-based autonomous agents. They  introduce Tool Graph to represent the decomposed tasks, and adopt a back-instruct method to generate instructions. The evaluation is conducted from task decomposition, tool invocation, and parameter prediction.

### Strengths
+ The paper is well-written and easy to read.

+ The paper studies an important question, which very interesting under the era of autonomous AI agent.

### Weaknesses
- The paper focuses on the evaluation of task solving (agent) capabilities of different LLMs. Although the experiments are enough, the analyses are partial. For instance, which contributes to the performance of different LLMs? What are the intrinsic difference between different existing LLMs in performing agent tasks? Which findings can we derive to better improve the capabilities of current open-source LLMs? Personally,  insights from the evaluation results are somehow shallow.

- For an evaluation paper, I think more diverse LLMs should be evaluated as well, such as Claude-2. I also expect a case study to show the performance gap among different LLMs.

- Missing discussion with a very relevant work ToolLLM [1]. The workflow is quite similar: preparing high quality tools (or APIs), back-generate the instructions that involve these APIs, and annotate how LLMs solve these instructions. The main difference is that this paper involves a concept of Tool Graph when organizing the structure of tools/APIs. Though ToolLLM can be considered as a concurrent work,  I think the authors should discuss their core differences and the unique advantage of this submission (experiments, findings, etc.).

### Summary
The paper proposes a new benchmark for evaluating large language models' capabilities in completing user requests by utilizing external tools. The benchmark is constructed by first representing a collection of tools as a graph, sampling subgraphs representing valid tasks, and finally back-instructing GPT-4 in generating corresponding user requests based on the sampled subgraphs. The evaluation shows that current LLMs can still struggle in predicting correct tool-use plans for complex tasks.

### Strengths
- The paper introduces a timely benchmark for evaluating LLMs' tool-use capabilities. It's a good effort to make the evaluation more standardized since there is an increasing volume of work in this area.
- Representing tools as graphs is interesting, since the graph structure allows more diverse and complex tasks. The authors also include 3 sets of tools for different scenarios.
- Back-instruct is a natural approach to construct the benchmark. However, I have concerns on the resulting data quality (see below).

### Weaknesses
 - One of my concern is that depending on the subgraph sampling procedure (which is not clearly described in the paper), the task might be unnatural (deviating from what users would ask in real-world) while being valid. For example, one can always make a complex task by combining many tools "Tool 1" --> "Tool 2" --> ....".Tool N", while the task is rarely encountered in real-world. Does the sampling procedure take "task naturalness" into account? Also, I'd suggest to include some actual examples in the paper.
- While back-instructing to generate user requests is an intuitive approach. This procedure relies on GPT-4 and there is no guarantee that the generated data is correct (e.g., many of the examples are filtered out by simply using rule-based critics as mentioned). Even if more advanced LLM-based critic is used, there may still be wrong examples. Since the dataset is intended for evaluation, the data quality is of most the utmost importance. Without further (potentially manual) verification, it is not very convincing on the reliability of the benchmark.
- As discussed in related work, there are several parallel efforts in creating benchmarks for LLM tool usage, and perhaps the most related is ToolBench [1]. Can the authors provide more detailed discussion/comparison to the work, and highlight the contribution in this work?

### Questions
- Tool graph construction: is there an example on the constructed tool graph before subsampling?
- In Figure 3, GPT-4 almost reaches 100% in performance, would the benchmark will be saturated soon, perhaps when the next generation LLMs come out?

### Summary
This work introduces a benchmark called TaskBench to evaluate LLMs for task automation. It includes three stages: task decomposition, tool invocation, and parameter prediction. In particular, it considers tools in a graph structure, which could motivate more complicated applications of LLM for task automation. It leverages back-instruct to automatically create the test cases. Extensive evaluation show the utility of this benchmark in evaluting LLMs' capability of task automation.

### Strengths
1. The introduction of an open-source benchmark with tool graph is nice, it fills the blank in the field. And the three scenarios included are interesting and realistic
2. The back-instruct technique and the idea of sampling a subgraph from the whole task graph to build test cases are intuitive and sound
3. The experiments cover a wide range of both black-box and open-source models with various metrics

### Weaknesses
1. I like the back-instruct, but LLM-generated queries can be biased and not well-aligned with user behavior. In addition, for the benchmark to be faithful (which is very important given that benchmark is what people would use to assess model in a relatively long period), the query and answer should be matched, I doubt whether the rule-based and LLM-based check could always ensure the correctness of the generated instruction. I do think human verification on all the generated instruction can make the benchmark more faithful.

**I took a close look at the huggingface dataset produced in this paper, a large portion of them are incorrect. For example, one of the data (id: 10949228), the user query  is "I have an image 'example.jpg' containing some information. I want to convert the image content into text and then answer the question: 'What is the main topic of the image?", the tool graph is Image-to-text -> VQA. However, once you do image-to-text (assuming captioning), why VQA? it makes no sense. it can just be a textual QA, right? There are many similar cases in the dataset.**

2. I don't quite understand the goal of evaluating task decomposition as textual descriptions. I do think evaluating task decomposition is important, but as long as it can build the correct tool graph and predict the correct parameter, it is good enough. So I don't think evaluating textual description is necessary, and given how diverse the textual description could be, the current automatic evaluation metric could be misleading.

### Questions
See weakness

1. when you build a DAG tool graph, do you consider one graph that contains multiple disconnected DAG?
2. Are tool graphs with more nodes more challenging? I think analysis of the correlation between the difficulty of the test cases and their numbers of nodes is interesting.
