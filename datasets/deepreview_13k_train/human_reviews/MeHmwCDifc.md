- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 5, 5, 6

## Abstract
Standard practice within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) involves optimizing against a Reward Model (RM), which itself is trained to reflect human preferences for desirable generations. A notable subject that is understudied is the (in-)consistency of RMs --- whether they can recognize the semantic changes to different prompts and 
appropriately adapt their reward assignments

--- and their impact on the downstream RLHF model.

In this paper, we visit a series of research questions relevant to RM inconsistency:
(1) How can we measure the consistency of reward models? 
(2) How consistent are the existing RMs and how can we improve them? 
(3) In what ways does reward inconsistency influence the chatbots resulting from the RLHF model training?


We propose **Contrast Instruction** -- a benchmarking strategy for the consistency of RM.  
Each example in **Contrast Instruction** features a pair of lexically similar instructions with different ground truth responses. A consistent RM is expected to rank the corresponding instruction and response higher than other combinations. We observe that current RMs trained with the standard ranking objective fail miserably on \contrast{} compared to average humans. To show that RM consistency can be improved efficiently without using extra training budget, we propose two techniques **ConvexDA** and **RewardFusion**, which enhance reward consistency 
through extrapolation during the RM training and inference stage, respectively.
We show that RLHF models trained with a more consistent RM yield more useful responses, suggesting that reward inconsistency exhibits a trickle-down effect on the downstream RLHF process.

### Summary
The authors study reward models that are used for RLHF  to tune LLMs for desirable generations. Specifically the aspect of (in-)consistency is studied. The paper studies the following research questions:

- How to measure in-consistency of reward models? : 
  - The authors introduce the Contrast Instructions benchmarking strategy to measure in-consistency.
  - The benchmark consists of quadruplets consisting of lexically similar instructions but different responses. Two metrics are proposed: 
    - Response consistency: Can the RM assign a higher score to the correct response given the instruction 
    - Instruction consistency: Can the RM assign a higher score to the correct instruction given the response. 
  - The benchmarking is automatically constructed using existing open source human preference datasets. A sentence embedding model SimSE is used to find pairs of instructions that are lexically similar, but semantically different. 
  - This strategy has been explored with 4 popular open source human preference datasets. 
  - They find a huge performance gap on this benchmark between human judgements and reward models trained with the 7B LLaMa checkpoint
- How to reduce the gap and improve consistency of reward models? : Two techniques ConvexDA and RewardFusion are introduced that can be incorporated into the training and inference stage of reward models at no additional computation cost. The authors show this helps improve consistency. 
  - ConvexDA: At training time, the data is augmented by substituting words in the responses with synonyms generated using WordNet 
  - RewardFusion:  At inference time, a weighted average reward score between similar training examples and given instruction response pair is used
- How does reward inconsistency influence downstream performance of chatbots after RLHF? : The authors show that using a more consistent RM for RLHF can lead to more preferable downstream generations.

### Strengths
- The paper proposes a new way of evaluating reward models and focuses on the new important aspect of consistency of reward models. It also highlights how existing reward model evaluation methods do not capture this aspect. 
- The benchmark creation for evaluation is intuitive and automatic and can be easily applied to any existing instruction tuning dataset 
- The paper highlights the importance of using more consistent reward models for RLHF 
- The paper also propose simple methods that show slight improvements in performance on the proposed evaluation metric

### Weaknesses
 - Contrast instructions benchmark: To sample lexically similar but semantically different pairs of instructions the authors only sample instruction pairs that lie within the similar range of 0.75 and 0.9. It would be useful to explain the sensitivity of this hyperparameter and study how well this prevents sampling semantically similar instructions. Specifically, it is unclear how the cosine similarity threshold was chosen and if the chosen range is optimal for creating a challenging benchmark. A more thorough analysis of the impact of this range on the quality of the contrastive pairs is needed. For example, what is the distribution of semantic similarity scores within the chosen range, and how does this distribution affect the difficulty of the benchmark?
- When evaluating existing RM on this benchmark the reward models get a low C_res score of 53.6, even though C_res conceptually resembles the RM learning objective. This is surprising given the benchmark was constructed using the same datasets used for training. It would be useful to verify if appropriate hyper-parameter tuning was performed and if the model is able to overfit and get a high C_res score. It is important to understand if the low C_res score is due to a limitation of the model or if it is a result of insufficient training or hyperparameter optimization. The authors should provide more details on the training procedure and hyperparameter tuning to rule out these possibilities. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to investigate if the model can achieve a higher C_res score when trained specifically on the contrastive instruction dataset.
- Limited models and scales: It would be useful to explore more pretrained models and perform a model and dataset scaling analysis to measure if and how the consistency of reward models varies across different models and scales and if similar observations are found. Would be useful to do a similar analysis when evaluating the impact of the proposed improvement methods ConvexDA and RewardFusion to see how well they perform with different models. It is crucial to understand if the observed trends are consistent across different model architectures and sizes. The authors should investigate how the performance of the proposed methods scales with model size and if the improvements are consistent across different models. This analysis should include a variety of model sizes and architectures to ensure the robustness of the findings.
- It would be useful to explain how the proposed data augmentation and inference time technique are designed to help with improving the performance in contrast instructions benchmark. This is especially important given the very small improvement on the Contrast Instructions benchmark with the proposed approaches. The authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the mechanisms by which ConvexDA and RewardFusion are expected to improve consistency. It is not clear how these methods address the specific challenges posed by the contrastive instruction benchmark. A more thorough analysis of the impact of these methods on the model's ability to distinguish between similar instructions and responses is needed.
- The two methods ConvexDA and RewardFusion that are proposed are not used to build more consistent reward models that are used during the RLHF stage. Instead fine tuning on contrast instructions format is used. However, in appendix C, it is mentioned the “more consistent” reward model is equipped with ConvexDA.
  - It would be useful to evaluate models that have been trained (during RLHF) using reward models that are equipped with the proposed strategies (ConvexDA and RewardFusion) to show the improvements brought by this approach
  - Please clarify what “finetuning with contrast instructions format” consists of
  - Please clarify if ConvexDA was used to train the reward models for this stage as mentioned in the appendix.

### Questions
- Could you please explain how the proposed approaches are designed to help address the inconsistency in the reward model?
- Could you explain the reason behind the very low C_res score of the trained reward model on the same dataset, even though C_res resembles the RM training objective?
- Could you explain what finetuning on contrast instruction format dataset involves?

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of Reward Model (RM) inconsistency and its impact on the downstream RLHF model. The paper introduces the "Contrast Instruction" benchmark to measure the ability of a reward model to consistently recognize semantic changes in prompts and adapt reward assignments accordingly. It then shows that current RMs trained with standard ranking objectives underperform compared to human judgment on this benchmark. To address this inconsistency issue, the paper proposes two innovative techniques: "ConvexDA" and "RewardFusion," which leverage extrapolation during RM training and inference, respectively, to enhance RM consistency without requiring additional training resources. The authors demonstrate that these advancements lead to more useful responses from RLHF models trained with a more consistent RM, highlighting the crucial role of consistency in maximizing the effectiveness of the RLHF process.

### Strengths
1. The paper presents a novel way to investigate inconsistency in reward model via constructing benchmarks with inconsistent instruction and response pairs. The paper further proposes a fine-tuned reward model on top of the contrastive instruction-response pairs, which leads to improved RLHF performance. I think the investigation sheds insight in the RLHF research field and the proposed method is neat and effective.

2. The authors have performed extensive empirical study of the inconsistency of RMs, which clearly show that the current RMs do suffer from inconsistencies. The paper also provides thorough empirical evidence that shows the RLHF model can improve a lot with a more consistent RM trained on the constructed contrastive pairs of instruction and response.

### Weaknesses
1. It's a little unclear why CONVEXDA is used as a way to robustify the RM. It seems that it might work because it specifically targets the proposed benchmark, which mainly tests inconsistent instruction-response pairs with lexically similar words, but I'm not sure if the method can work well in scenarios where inconsistent responses/instructions are beyond just lexically similar words with different meanings. Moreover, I wonder if it would work equally well to simply use a different LLM to generate those similar pairs for augmentation.

2. I'm also less clear about why REWARDFUSION is needed and how it contributes to fixing inconsistency. Again, it seems to mainly target the type of inconsistency due to lexically similar words with different meanings, which may not be general enough.

### Questions
1. Please clarify how general the CONVEXDA and REWARDFUSION are in fixing inconsistency beyond lexically similar but different words.
2. Please compare to methods that simply use LLMs for data augmentation.

### Summary
The paper studies reward models in RLHF under the lens of consistency -- whether the RM can adapt its scores to semantic changes to different prompt response pairs. The authors create benchmarks to verify consistency of rewrd models called Contrast Instruction where the authors study the reward model score for lexically similar instructions with different responses. They claim that current RM with the standard loss functions suffer in these contrast instructions compared to human preferences. The authors provide two techniques -- one at train time and one at inference time that improve reward consistency through extrapolation across similar examples. They also claim that reward model consistency has a correlation with the usefulness of the RLHF responses.

### Strengths
The paper exposes an interesting and useful aspect of reward modeling in RLHF -- reward model consistency. Apart from standard RM eval, evaluating RMs for consistency is an important aspect that future works can take into consideration or the current eval sets be expanded to include this as a benchmark task. The authors clearly define what consistency means and setup constrast instructions dataset to evaluate the reward models. While the dataset needs to be vetted more carefully, having this dataset as part of standard RM evals could be a useful exercise for practitioners. The methods that the authors propose to improve consistency are simple to implement.

### Weaknesses
While the paper exposes an important aspect of reward models, one thing that could be improved about in  the paper is the limited nature of experiments and evaluation.

*  I was not sure of whether the contrast instructions generated automatically do mean something different where one answer is strictly better than the other -- for instance . The authors say they restricted this based on a particular cosine distance range, but some more rigorous evaluation around this could have made the impact of the dataset a bit stronger. For instance, one can query a bigger open LLMs in order to validate that the contrast instructions are fit for purpose. The other option could have been to conduct human eval on a randomly selected subset of the contrast instructions dataset. 

*  The authors could have just chosen one single baseline LLAMA 7B and use that to validate their claims. The behaviour of LLAMA 7B could be ground in the kinds of datasets and training procedures that it was subject to. Having few other RM baselines trained with similar RM training loss could have made the claims even more stronger.

 *  The human evaluation was done on 100 randomly selected data points and no standard errors and variance numbers were reported around the results. Since some of the results are close to each other, having the error bands around the result should help clarify the significance of improvements.

One other concern about human evaluation that I have is about the possibilities of potential bias as the authors themselves serve as human annotators for human eval of the results. There are several important statements made in this paper based on human evaluation. I would have preferred at least a mixture of external annotators (who are not aware of the work or how the responses were generated) to de-bias the evaluations. 
"Finally, we report human performance resulting from the majority vote of three human annotators (the authors) on 100 randomly selected data points."

### Questions
I have the following questions for the authors

1. There were certain choices of methods made in terms of methods for response/instruction similarity and the dataset construction including the augmented data points for ConvexDA. Have other methods been evaluated and ablated against before choosing these methods ? I wanted to understand if we are doing the best we can in terms of construction of these datasets and methods.

2. I know you have considered the classic RM loss, log (sigmoid (R_chosen - R_rejected)) ? Have you considered other loss functions such as the margin loss used in LLAMA 2 ? I am not specifically looking for one kind of loss, but just a choice of few other RM losses. Considering different losses can help us understand whether RM inconsistency arises from the dataset or the kind of losses used or a combination of both. This would be a good ablation to understand where RM developers should focus more of their efforts on.

3. Lot of times, RM training can easily lead to overfitting to the training datasets and creating a generalization gap in the process. Can you kindly explain how you do model selection for RM training for the baseline and your variants ?

4. I know that you choose only a single example in ConvexDA while you construct a few semantically similar examples. Have you evaluated what happens if you include all of them ? I know this is unfair to be compared to the baseline, but it would help us understand having how many semantically similar examples will be useful.

5.In table 2, I was not sure what (estimated) human performance means. Can you kindly clarify ?

6. I know evaluating with larger models would be resource intensive. But would it be possible to run the analysis with either a smaller or larger model than 7B to understand if and how reward model sizes influences reward consistency.

### Summary
The paper focuses on reward inconsistency while doing Reinforcement from Human Feedback studying the various reasons around such inconsistencies by developing relevant metrics to measure the same. They demonstrated the failure of the current reward models typically used in RLHF (with comparison to avg human)  on the CONTRAST INSTRUCTIONS introduced in the paper, which the authors attribute to reward inconsistency. Finally, the authors propose two strategies to mitigate such reward inconsistency with improved downstream performance.

### Strengths
The primary objective of the paper is to demonstrate the reward inconsistency with the standard RLHF training, as shown in Figure 1 where it shows for similar (but distinct) prompts, the rewards assigned are inconsistent with the current reward models. A primary reason attributed to the over-optimization is the fact that the current reward models are trained on datasets that don't represent close preferences in other words, the current reward models are not optimized for prompts where both the preferences are near-optimal and one is slightly better than the other. According to the authors, those are the places where the current reward models suffer and that's where CONTRAST INSTRUCTIONS helps in providing a meaningful evaluation and mitigation to such over-optimization.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper claims the issue in reward inconsistency is due to the reward over-optimization issue (citing Gao et, al). Still, the reason for such reward over-optimization and how that causes the inconsistencies in the particular Contrast Dataset is unclear.  More specifically the author claims that "From the RMs’ perspective, correctly distinguishing between a clearly good vs. bad response is easy". But the contrast dataset for example shown in Figure 1, they are very different questions although textually there are common words. Does that mean the current LLMs are not able to produce representations that can separate the two is not very clear and needs further clarification. For ex: "A is a  good student" and "A is a bad student", they have a lot of words in common but in representation space they should be extremely different and should be trivially separated if the representations are reasonable. Thus it's not very clear how Contrast Dataset is providing a challenging dataset to test RM model inconsistency.

2. Another point is that why such reward inconsistencies are not observed in standard available RLHF datasets like Carper AI, hh, etc. are not made explicit. Does it mean that the majority of the datasets are easily separable and lacks samples towards the optima which is hard for human to segregate? A comparison with current RLHF methods is critical on standard datasets to understand the significance and mitigation of the problem properly.

3. "Surprisingly, we observe close to random-chance performance ..while humans are able to rank the responses correctly in ≈ 80% of the cases" So, is it the case that humans are able to identify it but the reward models are not able to learn the same and failing is not very clear since its a supervised learning problem and can be shown to be strongly convex under certain settings. Hence, a clear description is missing on the same, and will be interesting to have a discussion with reference to the recent works showing convergence [1,2] and where this issue can arise in that context.

### Questions
1. Why augmentation helps as a solution to mitigate the problem is not clear in the context of the Contrast Dataset. Will be helpful to have a more rigorous discussion on the same?
2. ContrastDataset provides is challenging dataset, how are humans able to do good on it? Is it mainly hard for the LLMs since the representations are sub-optimal?
3. A comparison with current SOTA RLHF or reward models on standard/open-sourced datasets will be helpful in understanding the crux of the problem.
4. Recent work on Direct Pref Optimization (DPO) shows that it can learn with learning reward models, will such an issue happen there as well? 
5. Reward ensemble seems to work well in RLHF to mitigate over-optimization as also followed in [1] for Robotics. Will be interesting to see if that helps and have a discussion around the same.
6. The notations used in the equation after 1 (missing no) are not very clear and it will be helpful if they can be updated as per standard RL notations of trajectory, state, etc.

### Summary
This paper investigates an important yet often overlooked problem - the robustness of the reward model (RM). The authors propose a benchmarking technique called Contrast Instructions that gauges the reward consistency of an RM. The reward consistency is measured by consistency in preference ranking if given a pair of lexically similar instructions with different ground truth responses. Concretely, it is quantified by (1) response consistency, if the RM can identify the better response for a given instruction, and (2) instruction consistency, if the RM can identify the most fitting instruction for a given response. The benchmark dataset is constructed based on four open-source human preference datasets of various NLP tasks. The authors showcased that an RLHF model trained with a more reward-consistent RM outperforms an RLHF model trained with the original RM in human evaluations.

### Strengths
1. This paper is well-written and it is easy to follow.
2. The idea is straightforward but the underlying research problem is significant and yet often overlooked.
3. The trickle-down effect of reward consistency on RLHF training is an interesting observation, which intuitively makes sense.
4. Table 7 is helpful in seeing that reward consistency and test set accuracy (if I understood correctly) do not necessarily correlate. This is similar in the sense that the (dis-)correlation between human score and FID is often discussed in generative models.

### Weaknesses
1. The way that the authors constructed the dataset, is filtering by the cosine similarity between SimCSE embeddings that are in the range of [0.75, 0.9]. This seems convenient but I wonder how reliable is this method. Have you done a manual inspection to measure the agreement rate between the method and human evaluators? Or maybe you could try using a model-based approach like prompting GPT-4?
2. As I am more interested in the benchmark dataset itself, the evaluation for dataset validation seems limited. **The author should focus on providing a reliable benchmark as the major scientific contribution**; I believe the finetuning methods discussed in the manuscript are not as significant. Therefore, the authors should provide more evaluation results on more LLMs (open-source + closed-source) to validate your benchmark dataset. The evaluation results on popular models like GPT-4 would be very helpful. Although you can't get the weights, test by prompting would be sufficient. I am also curious to know the difference in consistency between the pre-trained model vs their SFT-ed version (i.e. llama2-7b vs llama2-7b-chat). If the compute resource allows, the parameter scaling on reward consistency could also be an interesting point for investigation.
3. The benchmark dataset should be submitted along with the paper, as I believe this is the core contribution of the paper.
4. The data variances in Figure 3 make the comparison in Sec. 7.2 rather inconclusive. However, I praised the authors' honesty in showing error bars.

### Questions
1. How concerned are you about the risk of data leakage? What implications would arise if instances from the benchmark dataset were also present in LlaMa-7B's pre-training data or the dataset used to train the reward model? Have such overlaps impacted the assessment of reward consistency?
2. I need more details on Section 4. For "Single-Task", what is the split between train and test?
3. For Section 4, why would you fine-tune a benchmark dataset? And the fact that it performs so poorly after being trained and tested on the same dataset distribution is surprising. The consistency improvement seems marginal.
4. What is RMEval in Table 7? Test set accuracy on binary classification task?

Overall I am positive about this paper. This is an interesting piece of research. If the authors can properly address mines and other reviewer's concerns, I will agree to raise my review score.
