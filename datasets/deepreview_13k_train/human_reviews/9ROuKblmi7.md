# NECO: NEural Collapse Based Out-of-distribution detection

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 5, 6, 6

## Abstract
Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is a critical challenge in machine learning due to model overconfidence, often without awareness of their epistemological limits. 
We hypothesize that ``neural collapse'', a phenomenon affecting in-distribution data for models trained beyond loss convergence, also influences OOD data. To benefit from this interplay,
we introduce NECO, a novel post-hoc method for OOD detection, which leverages the geometric properties of ``neural collapse'' and of principal component spaces to identify OOD data. 
Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NECO achieves state-of-the-art results on both small and large-scale OOD detection tasks while exhibiting strong generalization capabilities across different network architectures. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of our method in OOD detection. Code is available at \url{https://gitlab.

### Summary
This paper proposes to study OOD detection from the perspective of Neural Collapse. In that regard, they proposed NECO, Neural Collapse-based OOD Detection. NECO involves calculating the relative norm of a sample within the subspace configuration adopted by the ID data (i.e., Simplex ETF). The authors show that NECO exhibits strong generalization capabilities across various network architectures.

### Strengths
This paper is overall well-written although the wording can somewhat be simplified (see weaknesses). The idea is quite simple and intuitive. The method is thoroughly evaluated and shows great performance against many benchmark datasets and OOD detection methods.

### Weaknesses
1. At times, the manuscript is a bit misleading. For instance, the sentence "Intuitively, these properties depicts the tendency of the network to maximally separate class features while minimizing the separation within them" is quite counter-intuitive. I'd suggest the authors to proofread the manuscript again to make it easier to digest.

2. Although NECO shows strong ID classification and OOD detection capabilities across aggregated benchmarks, it undeperformson standalone datasets such as ImageNet-O, Textures, and iNaturalist depending on the encoding architecture that is used. An explanation for this behavior could make a stronger case for the paper.

3. Since NECO is a post-hoc method, it is not obvious from the manuscript at what point in the training process does the neural collapse occurs for NECO to kick in. In other words, a model could still be well-trained without necessarily reaching the neural collapse phase. In that specific case, would NECO require training the model a bit more, or how would NECO's performance compare with say NuSA or ViM?

4. NECO makes a somewhat stringent assumption that the subspace of the ID (and OOD?) is linear by making use of PCA to learn the matrix $P$ spanned by the d eigenvectors corresponding to the largest d eigenvalues of the covariance matrix $H$, where $H$ represents the feature space of the ID data. I think a justification as to why this feature space is linear is important. A non-linear dimensionality reduction, or a manifold-based learning method, would be more appropriate given the fact that neural nets are non-linear in nature.

### Summary
This paper proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection method based on the phenomenon of neural network collapse, called NECO.The authors design an anomaly detection metric by exploiting several properties of neural networks during the training process, such as decreasing intraclass variance, equidistribution of class means, self-pairing of class means with classifiers, and orthogonality of class means with anomalous data. And experiments were conducted on several datasets and models to prove the effectiveness of NECO.

### Strengths
1.	A novel and simple anomaly detection metric is proposed that exploits the geometric nature of the neural network training process.
2.	Uses a large number of experiments on multiple datasets and models to demonstrate the effectiveness of NECO and compares it to other methods
3.	A clear and convincing theoretical analysis is provided, revealing the mechanisms and assumptions behind NECO.
4.	The article is well-structured with clear diagrams and well-defined notation.

### Weaknesses
1.  The article does not discuss the conditions and scope of the neural network collapse phenomenon, such as whether specific loss functions, activation functions, optimizers, etc.
2.  The article does not analyze the sensitivity of anomaly detection metrics. Specifically, it is unclear how the performance of NECO is affected by the choice of PCA dimensionality or other hyperparameters involved in its calculation. A more rigorous sensitivity analysis is needed to understand the robustness of the method.
3.  The article does not explore the interpretability of anomaly detection metrics, such as whether it can give the causes or characteristics of anomalous data. It remains unclear what specific features or patterns in the data are being captured by the NECO metric that lead to the detection of anomalies. This lack of interpretability limits the practical applicability of the method in scenarios where understanding the nature of anomalies is crucial.

### Questions
1.	In section 3.2, "Nervous Breakdown", could more visual explanations or visual diagrams of the nature of NC1 and NC2 be provided?
2.	Is the observation of Out of Distribution Neural Collapse mentioned in Section 4 based on some existing theoretical or experimental evidence? If it is based on experimental evidence, please provide more detailed experimental settings and results.
3.	Section 3 introduces many notations and definitions, but there seems to be no visual explanation or context for each definition. Could consideration be given to providing more context or explanation for each of the main definitions?
4.	Why was this particular form chosen to define NECO(x) in Eq. (8)? What is the intuition or theoretical basis behind it?
5.	Referring to the use of PCA for visualization, is it possible to describe in more detail the specific application of PCA, e.g. the number of principal components chosen?
6.	Are the limitations or possible failure scenarios of the proposed method further explored or analyzed?
7.	Throughout the article, is it possible to provide a complete flowchart or pseudo-code of the algorithm to help readers better understand the whole process of NECO?
8.	In experimental setup, are different network architectures or hyperparameters considered to validate the robustness of the approach?
9.	Have the authors considered the impact of different types of OOD data? For example, have the authors considered situations where OOD data is very similar to ID data?

### Summary
In this paper, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method, NECO, is presented. NECO utilizes the geometric properties of neural collapse (NC) and principal component space to identify OOD data. This paper hypothesizes that NC not only affects the convergence of the loss during training but also impacts OOD detection.

### Strengths
1. This paper is clearly motivated and well-written.
2. This paper is innovative in the novel observation of ID/OOD orthogonality(NC5).
3. This paper provides thorough theoretical analysis.
4. Experimental results on the ImageNet and CIFAR benchmarks demonstrate that NECO is state-of-the-art. And NECO can be generalized to various backbones.

### Weaknesses
1. The NECO score is similar to the ViM score. The main difference is that the NECO score utilizes principal space features, while the ViM score utilizes null space features for OOD detection.
2. The manuscript lacks critical baseline comparisons, such as [1]. It is recommended that the authors conduct a comparison with it to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.

### Questions
Why not put NuSA in the baseline? Can NECO outperform NuSA?

### Summary
This work investigates the impact of Neural Collapse on the detection of OOD samples. They observe that, as training progresses,
ID and OOD data separability increases in the embedding space. Their proposed detection score computes the ratio between the norm of the projected embeddings with a PCA and the norm of the embedding. They multiply the final score with the maximum logit output to boost
performance. They run experiments with common benchmarks on image classification.

### Strengths
The work is well motivated with inspiration from a phenomenon studied usually exclusively for ID data: neural collapse. By revealing a novel property
in the presence of OOD data, they contributed to a better understanding of the NE phenomenon. 

They also display improvements on the benchmark compared to some previous work in OOD detection.

### Weaknesses
 **Theoretical soundness:** One of the main contributions of the paper is Theorem 4.1. But the proof is hard to follow and does not provide enough detail
(e.g., "based on the mathematical underpinnings of PCA"). Taking a more pragmatic and didactic approach could clarify the proof and strengthen the theoretical results of the paper.

**Empirical benchmark:** The benchmark on ImageNet is missing results on other popular architectures, such as ResNet, that are present only on the CIFAR
benchmark only. Results on ResNet-50 are highly appreciated and common in a plethora of previous work, and I believe would strengthen the empirical benchmark of the paper.

Some passages of the paper are hard to follow. The writing and especially the notation can be polished.

 The hyper-parameter tuning procedure to obtain $d$ is not present in the main manuscript, nor is Section C.5 cited in the main text. The behavior of ResNet-18 and ViT seems quite different when d approaches D. Why is that (Figure C.5b)?

Even though the performance on Vision Transformers is strong, the mixed results on ResNet make it hard to claim state-of-the-art (Contribution #3). The presented method seems to be marginally better than existing ones.

### Questions
1. Some notations are not clear to me. What does the operator $avg_{c,c^\prime}$ mean? $\frac{1}{c}\frac{1}{c^\prime}\sum_{i=1}^c\sum_{j=1}^{c^\prime}(\cdot)_{ij}$?
2. I would suggest the authors run experiments on ResNet-50 on the ImageNet benchmark to strengthen their empirical results.
3. What is the detection performance of only equation (8)? I suggest the authors to ablate on the influence of the MaxLogit multiplied to it.
4. In equation 6, I'm assuming the numerator goes to zero, and the denominator is always bounded. Is this correct?
5. On the proof, it states that $C\leq d \leq D$, but what if $C> D$? Which is usually the case for ImageNet-1K.
6. I may have missed it in the text, but how do the authors select the parameter $d$ for the PCA projection?
