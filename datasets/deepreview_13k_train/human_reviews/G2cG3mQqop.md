# Image Clustering Conditioned on Text Criteria

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 8, 8

## Abstract
Classical clustering methods do not provide users with direct control of the clustering results, and the clustering results may not be consistent with the relevant criterion that a user has in mind. In this work, we present a new methodology for performing image clustering based on user-specified text criteria by leveraging modern vision-language models and large language models. We call our method \textbf{I}mage \textbf{C}lustering Conditioned on \textbf{T}ext \textbf{C}riteria (IC$|$TC), and it represents a different paradigm of image clustering. IC$|$TC requires a minimal and practical degree of human intervention and grants the user significant control over the clustering results in return. Our experiments show that IC$|$TC can effectively cluster images with various criteria, such as human action, physical location, or the person's mood, while significantly outperforming baselines.}

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The paper describes a simple prompting method to perform image clustering using existing vision-language models and LLMs. The method is very straightforward, simply relying on image captioning, then prompting to distill keywords and perform clustering. There is little novelty, but the method performs well and the experiments demonstrate strong performance against recent baselines.

### Strengths
Interactive editing of the criterion to refine clustering results is a significant strength of the approach. This feature is practical, and intuitive for users, as is the basic premise of the user providing an initial clustering criterion.

The experiments are reasonable, and show that the method can incorporate semantic conditions on the clustering operation (which is done through a prompt clause). A variety of datasets are used to show different aspects of the work, and for comparison against baseline clustering methods that cannot incorporate conditioning. One particularly interesting experiment is to instruct the LLM to ignore gender, to mitigate bias, with successful results.

### Weaknesses
The comparison to related work does not include the body of work in language-guided image retrieval, which seems highly relevant here, particularly since many of those methods use a vision-language encoder and indexing scheme that clusters the image archive according to linguistic concepts, as the proposed approach does implicitly. However, given that the method does not address the underlying representation, but just relies on the LLM to perform clustering as a black box, this is a minor concern.

The discussion of prior work in deep clustering is also very brief, and does not position the proposed contributions against current, relevant work. 

The method requires prior specification of the number of clusters, which is a significant limitation and drawback. 

The method is very simple, just a set of straightforward text prompts. The crucial step of doing the clustering is just deferred to the LLM itself, by asking it to cluster N labels into K categories.

### Questions
I have revised my review after reading the other reviews and the authors' responses. I'm considerably more favorable on the paper, given its generally positive reception by others. The method does not present a clustering algorithm per se, and is more of an experimental analysis of how well an LLM can do clustering innately. However the experiments are sufficiently thorough and appears to be of interest to this community.

### Summary
The authors propose an image clustering technique based on text criteria driven by LLMs. They correctly point out that unsupervised clustering often does not yield results that would satisfy a human. They therefore propose clustering based on user specified criteria, which they ask the user to provide and then build on with prompt engineering. They use a three step process to first get the user criteria from the user, then extract relevant textual features from the images and then cluster based on those textual features.

### Strengths
1. Good literature survey.
2. Interesting proposed algorithm for clustering.
3. Interesting results.

### Weaknesses
1. I am not convinced that this problem is not merely a form of retrieval based on user specifications. 
2. The approach is inherently not testable at scale unless the authors expend a huge amount of human resources.
3. That is probably why the authors choose relatively small datasets of images that have strong structures.
4. I would be more favorably inclined if the authors could show that the proposed method is scalable to millions of images as per the state of the art.

### Questions
Please see my comments on weaknesses above.
I am satisfied with the authors' response to the extent that their method is scalable. I am therefore raising my score.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new clustering paradigm that aims at clustering images based on the criterion provided by users. By leveraging the pre-trained VLM and LLM, the proposed method could understand the user's request and partition images accordingly.

### Strengths
1. I think the problem this work tackles is very interesting. By using the pre-trained VLM and LLM, the proposed paradigm could cluster the images based on the user's criterion, which favors real-world applications.
2. The proposed method improves the clustering explainability by providing the cluster names.
3. The effectiveness of the method is proved by experiments on both user-specified clustering and classic semantic clustering.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper is more like an engineering guidance instance of a research work. In other words, the proposed method "violently" clusters the images, all based on pre-trained VLM and LLM. Though I acknowledge the good question and paradigm raised by this work, I feel it is better to incorporate some clustering techniques into the paradigm (maybe in future works).
2. The refinement operation also seems a bit violent. It seems that if the user is not satisfied with the current clustering results, the whole process is simply repeated. I wonder if the refinement could integrate the experience learned from the last process.
3. 100 samples from 10 location classes might have biases by random sampling. I suggest enlarging the datasets of location and mood so that they would become reliable benchmarks for future studies.
4. What is the difference between sending the image description in step 1 and the main object in step 2 into step 3?
5. There is a related recent work Image Clustering with External Guidance (arXiv 2023) that also leverages the text modality to enhance image clustering, which the authors are encouraged to include in the related works.

2. The paradigm of IC|TC is new
3. The experimental part is detailed and the clustering results are amazing

### Weaknesses
1. Since the model size of LLaMA-2 and GPT-4 are too big, the author can give more testing results on smaller models.
2. Some baseline models are missing, such as GCC[1] and TCC[2]
