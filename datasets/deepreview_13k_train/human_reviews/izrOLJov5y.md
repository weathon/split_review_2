- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 6, 8, 8

## Abstract
We present Spectron, a novel approach to adapting pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to perform spoken question answering (QA) and speech continuation. By endowing the LLM with a pre-trained speech encoder, our model becomes able to take speech inputs and generate speech outputs. The entire system is trained end-to-end and operates directly on spectrograms, simplifying our architecture. Key to our approach is a training objective that jointly supervises speech recognition, text continuation, and speech synthesis using only paired speech-text pairs, enabling a `cross-modal' chain-of-thought within a single decoding pass. Our method surpasses existing spoken language models in speaker preservation and semantic coherence. Furthermore, the proposed model improves upon direct initialization in retaining the knowledge of the original LLM as demonstrated through spoken QA datasets. We release our audio samples and spoken QA dataset via our website.\footnote{\textcolor{blue}{\href{https://michelleramanovich.io/spectron/spectron}{https://michelleramanovich.io/spectron/spectron}}}

### Summary
This paper proposes a new training scheme to build a large speech and language model. The idea is to split the paired speech utterance into the first 3-second segment and the rest. The first task is to predict the corresponding sentence given the first 3-second segment. This corresponds to 1) performing ASR corresponding to the first 3-second audio segment and 2) predicting the rest of the sentence conditioned by the first 3-second audio segment and its transcriptions, corresponding to the language modeling task if we ignore the first 3-second audio segment. Note that the actual implementation does not require the split in the text part. The second task is to perform the speech continuation task of the rest of the audio segment conditioned on the first 3-second audio segment and previously estimated sentence. Thus, this training scheme holds ASR, text continuation, and speech continuation tasks with a single training framework with the standard paired speech utterances. This model is built upon various speech and text pre-trained models and is fine-tuned with the public speech database based on Libri-Light. The paper also has multiple comparisons with the other methods for speech continuation and spoken QA tasks and shows the superiority of the proposed method.

### Strengths
- Building a speech foundation model by leveraging an LLM is a hot topic in ML and AI. Also, providing more powerful understanding capability for speech models is desired.
- A novel training algorithm to (implicitly) perform ASR, text continuation, and speech continuation tasks with the standard paired speech utterances.
- The paper shows a strong performance compared with other speech LM methods.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper lacks the reproducibility and accessibility of the results due to several pre-training models, which are not publicly available or cannot be reproduced due to the inaccessible training data (e.g., WaveFit and state-of-the-art Conformer ASR system (Zhang et al., 2023b)). I appreciate your efforts in mitigating the issue (e.g., the use of Libriright and the release of the SQA test set), but I think the paper still has this issue.
- Due to the above issue, it is not clear whether the superiority of the proposed method compared with other speech LMs comes from their novel training schemes or strong pre-trained models. Thus, the effectiveness, especially for the comparisons with other speech LMs, is weak.
- Clarity: Section 2 requires more improvements. There are many different aspects between the related studies and the proposed method, and it is not clear what is the advantage of this method. I recommend you rewrite Section 2 to categorize the different aspects (e.g., model architecture, training method, pre-training data, etc.) and emphasize the distinction between the proposed method and others.

### Questions
- Can you evaluate the ASR performance of this method? It would probably not be nice due to the over-prediction function in the ASR prediction phase (it will predict more than what was spoken), but it would be an interesting result to report. 
  - I have the same question for TTS. In this case, due to the lack of conditions, it may not work at all (?).
- Why is it 3 seconds? Would it robustly work even if we throw more than (or less than) 3-second spoken prompts?
- Similarly, how did you deal with sentences that are less than 3 seconds during training? Can you discard them or concatenate neighboring sentences to make it longer than 3 seconds?
- How about combining multiple sentences and using the original first sentence as a chunk instead of a 3-second chunk? In this case, we would also have access to the transcription corresponding to the spoken prompt part easily. We can have more precise control of the text output to perform ASR inside the framework explicitly.
- Around equation (3), $\mathcal{P}_s$: why does $\mathcal{P}_s$ depend on position $s$?
- In section 4.1, the last sentence, "For semantic and acoustic quality, Spectron was trained with a model of 350 million parameters, while for the question answering task, Spectron was trained with a model of 1 billion parameters," I could not understand it. Do you mean you use 350M models for Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 and 1 B models for Section 4.2.3? How are they different?
- Is the question-answering task performed with zero-shot without fine-tuning it? Please clarify it.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new spoken language model that operates on spectrograms and can simultaneously perform speech recognition, speech continuation, and text continuation (auto-regressive language modeling). The authors propose a model with a speech encoder, an LLM decoder, and a post network that takes in a sequence of speech input to produce its transcription, textual completion, and speech completion.  Experiments on LibriLight show that the proposed Spectron obtains better acoustic and semantic quality compared to other work. They also extend the approach to Spoken Question Answering and show that Spectron can do this almost as well as SpeechGPT.

### Strengths
1. The proposed approach is clear and simple. Experimental results demonstrate benefits from this approach compared to others. 

2. The idea of prompting order imposed that the authors claim resembles CoT is interesting.

### Weaknesses
1. The MOS evaluation of synthesis is bereft of details - it is important to mention the number of raters and the number of examples rated. The lack of information makes it hard to contextualize reported MOS scores. Further, since this paper is evaluating speech continuation as opposed to text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), it is unclear if standard MOS is the best evaluation strategy. Do the raters hear the original prompt before hearing the continuation from the model? Does the MOS in this case measure naturalness of the continuation or something else ?

2. The CoT idea is interesting as I mentioned before, but this paper could benefit from some analysis on how inter-dependent these outputs are in the trained model. That is, if the transcription contains errors, does that necessarily lead to poor text or speech continuation?

### Questions
A. No details are provided on MOS tests - could the authors share some details ?

B. What was the WER of the Librispeech model used to obtain pseudo-labels on LibriLight ? Do the authors have any idea about label quality ? 

C. The paper says "we use TTS to synthesize questions that fit within this duration" - what does this mean? Do you truncate long questions or modify the durations of phones/words to fit within 3s? Or do you drop questions that are longer than 3s?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel approach to adapt the pre-trained LLMs for spoken question answering and speech continuation. Specifically, a pre-trained speech model as well as some projection layers such as connector layer, pre-net, and post-net are utilized to process speech signals in the same way as text tokens in the LLMs. In this way, the adapted LLMs can take speech inputs and generate speech outputs and train speech recognition, text continuation, and speech synthesis using only paired speech-text pairs in an end-to-end fashion, where the text transcripts can be treated as a cross-modal chain-of-thought. The proposed spectrogram-powered LLMs surpasses existing spoken language models in speaker preservation, semantic coherence, as well as spoken question answering.

### Strengths
**Originality:** The concepts and methods of Spectron is novel. It adapts exiting pre-trained LLMs for spoken language modeling, and trains an end-to-end system that takes speech inputs and generates speech outputs.

**Quality:** This paper has solid experimental results. The proposed system doesn't achieve state-of-the-art results in some metrics though.

**Clarity:** This paper is well-organized and well-written.

**Significance:** The impact of the paper is good. However, the scale of the proposed system is relatively small compared to OpenAI voice-version ChatGPT.

### Weaknesses
I don't see major weaknesses. It would be great if the authors can also compare their system with OpenAI voice-version ChatGPT (https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-can-now-see-hear-and-speak).

### Questions
Will Spectron still work when using a LLM that has 100B parameters? Currently, Spectron uses 1B language model (PaLM 2), and that is much smaller than state-of-the-art LLMs. In addition, what happens if you use Whisper (https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf) to transcribe Libri-Light and obtain training transcripts $y$ ?

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors leverage a pretrained Language Model (LLM) and a pretrained speech encoder to tackle spoken question answering and speech continuation tasks. The proposed model processes spectrograms directly as inputs and outputs while utilizing a novel end-to-end objective for training. This objective implicitly supervises speech recognition, text continuation, and conditional speech synthesis tasks. Comprehensive experimental results validate the semantic and acoustic quality of the proposed model, showcasing its efficacy.

### Strengths
1. This work introduces a new end-to-end training paradigm for spoken language modeling, efficiently employing the pretrained Language Model (LLM) to enhance semantic quality.
2. The experimental results, along with the audio samples in the supplementary material, confirm the semantic and acoustic performance of the model.
3. The availability of the released test set offers the research community a valuable benchmark for assessing the semantic quality of spoken language models.
4. The presentation is clear and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
1. The association between generated text and speech can be further evaluated. For instance, performing a Word Error Rate (WER) test using speech, [xp, xc], and transcriptions [yp, yc] would be advantageous. In addition, replacing the text with a sequence of null tokens of the same length can help showcase the impact of text on semantic quality. These analyses would lead to a better understanding of the role that text plays in the proposed model.

### Questions
1. Could you please provide additional information about the training and inference in the Spoken QA task? Does SPECTRON undergo training for the spoken QA task, whereas the baselines, such as AudioLM and GSLM, does not?

2. In the provided Spoken QA demos, SpeechGPT tends to generate lengthier and more detailed answers, while SPECTRON prefers more concise responses. Could the comparable performance of both models be attributed to the nature of the QA task, such as the prevalence of shorter answers in the test set?
