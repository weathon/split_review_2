# Disco-Bench: A Context-Aware Evaluation Benchmark for Language Modelling

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 3, 5, 3

## Abstract
Modeling discourse -- the linguistic phenomena that go beyond individual sentences, is a fundamental yet challenging aspect of natural language processing (NLP). However, existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on the evaluation of inter-sentence properties and overlook critical discourse phenomena that cross sentences.
To bridge the gap, we propose Disco-Bench, a benchmark that can evaluate intra-sentence discourse properties across a diverse set of NLP tasks, covering understanding, translation, and generation.
Disco-Bench consists of 9 document-level testsets in the literature domain, which contain rich discourse phenomena (e.g. cohesion and coherence) in Chinese and/or English.
For linguistic analysis, we also design a diagnostic test suite that can examine whether the target models learn discourse knowledge.
We totally evaluate 20 general-, in-domain and commercial models based on Transformer, advanced pretraining architectures and large language models (LLMs). Our results show (1) the challenge and necessity of our evaluation benchmark; (2) fine-grained pretraining based on literary document-level training data consistently improves the modeling of discourse information.

### Summary
The paper presents a benchmark dataset that focuses on
learning/testing discourse phenomena. The dataset includes 9 different
tasks covering "language understanding", translation and text
generation tasks. As well as the main dataset (for training and
development), a small hand-crafted diagnostic test set and a large
unlabeled dataset for language model pretraining were proposed.
Except one, the monolingual datasets are in Chinese 
(simplified/classical), translation data is between Chinese variants
The paper also presents results for each task using multiple models.
and English.

### Strengths
As noted by the authors, most benchmark datasets focus on
single-sentences (or pairs). The study addresses a relatively less
covered area of benchmark datasets. Paying attention to the
theoretical background (at least during the construction of the
diagnostic test set), and providing examples relevant to coherence and
cohesion is also a strength of the paper.

### Weaknesses
 The main weakness of the study is unclear description of the data at
many places.

- The paper does not discuss copyright and ethical issues for any of
  the datasets. The source descriptions are also rather vague (e.g.,
  "we crawl 45,134 chapters in 152 books from web fiction websites"
  needs more explicit statements of these websites - perhaps in 
  appendix/supplementary material).
- Although some quality assurance (IAA/checks) are reported (Table 2),
  there are unclarities: Were the SI/ZPR/MRC data fully doubly
  annotated? Who were the annotators? Were there any annotation
  guidelines, well-defined procedures?
- Related to above, the description of the "diagnostic test data" is
  also rather terse, and insufficient.



### Questions
- It would be nice to specify if there were any issues of text size
  with smaller models trained. Since the texts are long, some models
  (e.g., BERT) may have to truncate the input, or use some other
  mechanism to process the complete data.

Typo/language issues:
- abstract: "We totally evaluate" -> "We evaluate"
- Fig. 1 caption: "propertie" -> "property"
- Table 1: better use full names of the tasks on column 1. There seems
  to be enough space.
- page 3 paragraph on SI: "all speakers are entities, speakers in our
  dataset can also be phrases" "all speakers are names, speakers in
  our dataset can also be phrases describing entities" ?
- page 3 paragraph on ZPR: ", while ZPR considers ..." -> ", ZPR
  considers ..."
- page 4 paragraph on NT: LDC is not a corpus, an organization hosting
  many corpora. If you want to compare your corpus to other parallel
  corpora, you probably need to compare with many available in OPUS.
  Only the subtitle section of the corpus collection does not support your claim.
- For corpora and tools referred to everywhere, prefer citing the
  papers describing them, rather than providing (non-permanent) URL
  references.
- page 6, first paragraph of section 3: "may be not sufficient" ->
  "may not be sufficient"
- Table 3: "Incorrect: She think the Qingshuang is funny." has a
  likely typo in the example: "think" should be "thinks". However,
  this may also point to a systematic error in the corpus. If so, it
  needs to be corrected.
- It is a good practice to report hyperparameters used, but it would
  also be informative to include a statement on how they were determined. Any hyperparameter tuning? Following an earlier example?

### Summary
The paper presents Disco-Bench---a benchmark of 9 tasks that focus on discourse phenomena. The 9 tasks are constructed with sources from the literature domain and span three groups of tasks: 1) language understanding (Speaker Identification, Zero Pronoun Recovery and Machine Reading comprehension), 2) language translation (Chinese-English Novel Chapter Translation, Classical-Modern Chinese Document-Level translation, Poetry Translation) and 3) language generation (Text expansion, text infilling and text completion). The paper also presents fine-grained diagnostic test sets that evaluate specific phenomena such as repetition, ellipsis, conjunctions ..etc. Additionally, the paper present a large pre-training corpus of long-texts in Chinese and English in the literature domain. Using Disco-Bench, the paper evaluate existing pre-trained models such as BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Results highlight that continued pre-training on in-domain text can boost the accuracy on Disco-bench task and even outperform GPT3.5 as well GPT4

### Strengths
1. The paper introduces a benchmark that consists of various tasks that target discourse phenomena.
2. The paper presents results that highlight the limitations of some of the powerful LLMs as well as commonly used smaller pre-trained models. 
3. The paper presents a large corpus of Chinese+English text in the literature domain shows that continued pre-training on such corpus can mitigate the limitations of some of the evaluated models.

### Weaknesses
1. For pre-trained models evaluation, the benchmark mixes up the Chinese language capabilities of the models under evaluation and the capabilities of such models with discourse phenomena. A model that excels at handling discourse phenomena but is limited with Chinese (e.g., due to lack of Chinese pre-training data) will still perform quite poorly on all tasks of the benchmark. This makes it difficult to isolate the impact of discourse-specific training from general language proficiency in Chinese. The benchmark tasks should be designed to disentangle these two factors, perhaps by including a control group of tasks that do not involve discourse phenomena but still require Chinese language understanding.

2. The paper does not provide any qualitative analysis that confirms the conclusions of the comparison results. Also, some of the results in Table 5 need to be explained or at least justified with a reasonable intuition. For example, why does Disco-Bench Pretraining significantly hurst ellipsis handling in the TC task? Also, Disco-Bench pretraining hurts most phenomena in the MRC task. The paper justifies that with "understanding tasks are mostly classification tasks, whose signals may not be sufficient to guide models to learn discourse information" which does not make sense since the continual pre-training phase is independent of the task! The lack of qualitative analysis makes it hard to understand the reasons behind the observed performance changes. For example, it would be beneficial to see examples of model outputs before and after Disco-Bench pretraining to understand how the model's behavior changes with respect to discourse phenomena.

3. Several important details about the benchmark construction and model evaluation are vague:

     3.1. In section 2.1, how was the ground truth constructed for the Speaker Identification task? What specific annotation guidelines were used to ensure consistency and accuracy? Was there any inter-annotator agreement analysis performed to measure the reliability of the annotations?

     3.2. In section 2.2., how were 45k chapters manually aligned at both the document and sentence-level? What is the definition of a document in the Novel translation task?  What tools or techniques were used to facilitate the manual alignment process, and what were the criteria for determining a correct alignment? How was the quality of the alignment verified?

     3.3. In Table 4, how were the English-only models (e.g. BERT and RoBERTa) fine-tuned for the tasks in Chinese? What specific techniques were used to adapt these models to handle Chinese text, and what were the hyperparameters used during fine-tuning?

### Summary
This presents 9 large discourse datasets with a focus on Chinese data (modern or classical), Chinese-English paired data, and one English task, alongside a diagnostics suite. 

It is very ambitious in not simply bundling 9 existing datasets but actually providing 9 new datasets, as well as a large unannotated data resource (2+ billion sentences). They train models on the raw data and their 9 tasks and provide evaluations using a range of these models, and they provide essentially a tenth task/dataset for diagnostic tests using perturbations of discourse markers.

### Strengths
- It is very ambitious in not simply bundling 9 existing datasets but actually providing 9 new datasets. 
- They seem to provide new coverage of the literary domain across a range of tasks.  
- They provide newly collected document-level MT datasets which, if of sufficient quality, seem like they would contribute great value. 
- They provide essentially a tenth task/dataset for diagnostic tests

### Weaknesses
 - I would have appreciated far more detail regarding how these datasets are annotated, and the paper lacks analysis to measure their quality.
- For almost every dataset, there is an existing dataset on that task and this paper proposes a new version of the task, without providing the advantages of their new task or enough details to compare them. That issue is particularly fraught for ZPR, where the benchmark proposes to replace a manually annotated dataset with an automatically generated one. The same issue arises with a lack of reasons provided for using this dataset in comparison to existing long-form Chinese benchmark (Guan et al. 2022)
- A number of these datasets dismiss relevant smaller high-quality datasets in exchange for automatically generated tasks, particularly in the context of the ZPR data. But there's simply no real experimental analysis that actually establishes the validity of making those judgement calls, or the quality of their automatically bootstrapped datasets

### Questions
I appreciate that the IAA scores are provided for ZP recovery, but I'm confused about the numbers: the ZPR has kappa in the 0.9+ (implying a very clear-cut task), but the best model performance of 34.3 in this data -- compared to 46.81 F1 model performance for other ZP resolution models from years ago , which are presumably the same task (Song et al. (2020) -- https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.482.pdf). Do the authors have a suggestion for the reason for the dramatic difference in behavior across different Chinese ZP recovery tasks? Is the domain chosen particularly hard? 
What are the stars to the left of each figure? 
Table 1 caption says that"" means the number of instances (e.g. sentences, pairs or documents)." -- what are the units for SI, ZPR and MRC? Quotations, implied pronouns, and questions, I assume? 
I was confused at the actual evaluation of the diagnostic task: are models simply evaluated regarding whether they assign higher probability to the correct discourse marker?  Why do the authors not use this task to evaluate any models? 
The paper says their new MRC dataset "contains rich discourse phenomena", and is from "more challenging" domain, but doesn't provide any detail beyond document length. Could they provide any examples or analysis? 
Similarly, they claim the NT task contains "richer linguistic phenomena, especially in discourse.", but again provide no detail: could they explain what they mean? 
The authors claim that their "Novel Translation" dataset took 5,134 chapters in 152 books (Table 3 suggests it's 1.4 million units -- I assume sentences?) and they manually aligned it. Does that mean that the authors did millions of alignment annotations? If not, could they clarify their methodology?

### Summary
NLP test suites like Glue or Super Glue have been used for evaluating LM capabilities. This paper presents a new benchmark containing various NLP tasks, as well as a set of diagnostic probes. The two main claims to novelty by the authors are that : 1) This dataset contains both english and chinese sentences so it generalizes beyond just one language. 2) This diagnostic dataset portion of their benchmark requires models to understand discourse phenomena. The discourse understanding is quantified by measuring models along metrics such as Repetition, identifying Ellipsis, identifying substitutions.

### Strengths
This paper presents a new benchmark dataset and presents experiments using various LLMs on this dataset.

### Weaknesses
The benchmark tasks do not seem to be very novel and different from benchmarks such as Super Glue or LOT. The performance of existing pretrained Roberta (large) on the undertanding tasks is (88.7, 33.0, 55.9) which does not seem be very far from the performance of Disco-Bench pretrained models.

The majority of the "Disco-Bench benchmark" contains tasks such as translation, reading comprehension, question answering, and text completion, text infilling which are already covered by various other NLP benchmarks/datasets. The novelty in the paper seems to be the hand-crafted probe sentences in the diagnostic test suite that encompasses 6 cohesion properties .

The novelty in the paper seems to be the hand-crafted probe sentences in the diagnostic test suite that encompasses 6 cohesion properties . 

Why are these cohesion properties chosen ? Why are they important ? 

What portion of the performance difference in Table 5 b/w vanilla models, and disco-bench pretrained models comes simply from domain/language mismatch ?
