# Deep Temporal Graph Clustering

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 6, 8

## Abstract
Deep graph clustering has recently received significant attention due to its ability to enhance the representation learning capabilities of models in unsupervised scenarios. Nevertheless, deep clustering for temporal graphs, which could capture crucial dynamic interaction information, has not been fully explored. It means that in many clustering-oriented real-world scenarios, temporal graphs can only be processed as static graphs. This not only causes the loss of dynamic information but also triggers huge computational consumption. To solve the problem, we propose a general framework for deep Temporal Graph Clustering called TGC, which introduces deep clustering techniques to suit the interaction sequence-based batch-processing pattern of temporal graphs. In addition, we discuss differences between temporal graph clustering and static graph clustering from several levels. To verify the superiority of the proposed framework TGC, we conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results show that temporal graph clustering enables more flexibility in finding a balance between time and space requirements, and our framework can effectively improve the performance of existing temporal graph learning methods.

### Summary
This work focuses on deep temporal graph clustering and proposes a general framework for deep Temporal Graph Clustering called TGC, which introduces deep clustering techniques to suit the interaction sequence-based batch-processing pattern of temporal graphs. The experimental results are impressive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

### Strengths
1 The paper is well-written, structured and easy to follow. The authors provide sufficient implementation and experimental details in the Appendix. 
2 The authors' focus and exploration of temporal graph clustering may shed new light on the graph learning community.
3 The experiments are extensive and the results are presented in a clear and concise manner.

### Weaknesses
1 The authors mention that datasets are processed by batches, so for each batch does that mean it is a subgraph structure obtained by sampling? Or what is the difference between this way of processing the data in batches, compared to the way of training according to subgraphs?

2 I would like the authors to further discuss the practical application of temporal graph clustering in real-world scenarios to demonstrate the significance of this ‘new’ task.

3 The authors need to check the paper for grammatical and spelling errors, such as the wrong quotation marks above the Eq (7).

### Questions
Why isn't there more discussion about the two new datasets that you developed yourself in the paper? It doesn't seem to be presented very well in the appendix section either.

### Summary
This paper studies temporal graph clustering via graph neural networks. Temporal graphs have been widely investigated in the graph community. However, the topic of temporal graph clustering is less explored. The authors argue that this is because of lacking datasets suitable for clustering, thus several datasets are carefully selected by the authors for experiments. Moreover, the authors also introduce two tricks (i.e., clustering assignment distribution and adjacency matrix reconstruction) to improve existing models’ performance on temporal graph clustering task. Experimental results on 6 public datasets demonstrate that the proposed general framework TGC can outperform recent baselines with different gains.

### Strengths
1)	This paper investigates temporal graph clustering, which is less explored in the graph community.
2)	Both large and small datasets are used in the experimental sections and the results demonstrate the proposed model achieve really good performance.
3)	Memory consumption and running time are reported to show the efficiency of the proposed framework.
4)	Ablation studies are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed components.

### Weaknesses
1) The technical contribution of this paper is very limited. The two introduced tricks (i.e., clustering assignment distribution and adjacency matrix reconstruction) have been widely used by existing works. Eq. 6 and Eq. 7 are commonly utilized in existing static graph clustering models. No new models are proposed in this paper.

2) This paper studies continuous-time dynamic graphs. The authors argue that their selected datasets are more suitable for temporal graph clustering tasks. However, it seems that it is not true. As we can see in Table 1, most of the selected datasets have very limited timestamps, which is not consistent with their claimed continuous-time dynamic graphs. They are more like discrete-time dynamic graphs. For example, the DBLP, arXivAI and arXivCS datasets usually contain publication year only.

3) The comparisons of GPU memory usage are not fair in Figure 2. The authors only compare their TGC with static deep clustering baselines that feed whole graphs. The authors should compare their TGC with existing temporal graph clustering baselines like HTNE, TGAT, JODIE, etc. The low consumption of TGC largely depend on its backbone model HTNE, thus it is hardly to say this is the advantage of TGC. This comment can also be applied to Figure 3. The running time should also compare with other temporal baselines.

4) In Figure 4, it is not clear what is TGN + TGC? Since TGC is based on HTNE, I guess what you mean is applying clustering assignment distribution and adjacency matrix reconstruction to TGN. If so, please give the ablation studies on each component.

There are lots of typos in the paper. Some of them are listed as follows:

“A sample general framework” should be “A simple general framework…”

“which we do not discuss here” should be “that we do not discuss here”

“Then We conduct” should be “Then, we conduct”

### Questions
1)	The comparisons of GPU memory usage are not fair in Figure 2. The authors only compare their TGC with static deep clustering baselines that feed whole graphs.
2)	The running time should also compare with other temporal baselines.
3)	It is not clear how clustering assignment distribution and adjacency matrix reconstruction will individually impact the model's performance.

### Summary
This paper expands deep graph clustering to temporal graphs from four aspects, including problem, algorithm, dataset, and evaluation. A generalized framework named TGC is proposed for temporal graph clustering. The authors demonstrate the superiority of TGC and provide sound insights via extensive experiments.

### Strengths
+ The motivation is clear. It is meaningful to expand deep clustering to temporal graphs. The presentation is excellent. 

+ The core idea is novel and easy to follow. The temporal loss mines graph temporal information and the clustering loss is improved with node-level distribution and batch-level reconstruction. 

+ The experiments are comprehensive. The analyses provide many significant insights for temporal graph clustering.

### Weaknesses
 - The authors just conduct the clustering algorithms one run. However, most clustering algorithms are not robust and are sensitive to random seeds.

- The performance of TGC on the Brain dataset is not promising. Please provide the explanation and analyses.

- The related work section is limited. The authors need to survey and compare more papers published in 2022 and 2023.

- Missing middle-scale datasets. The authors should explore the dataset size boundaries of the statics deep graph clustering methods.

- The chronological order training is a strong restriction. I’m concerned that such as this strong strict will limit the performance on some datasets. As I know, some methods can disrupt the graph structure for training.

- In Figure 11, point out which sub-figure represents the result on which dataset. Besides, ablation studies should be provided in the main text. Figure 2 is too small. In addition, there seems to be something wrong with the commas.

- Have you considered explaining the relationship between the number of nodes in the static graph and the number of edges in the temporal graph further? This is an exciting topic, i.e., what is the difference in the way of thinking about a problem when the focus shifts from nodes to edges?
