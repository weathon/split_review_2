# Constraining Non-Negative Matrix Factorization to Improve Signature Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 6, 3

## Abstract
Collaborative filtering approaches are fundamental for learning meaningful low-dimensional representations when only association data is available. Among these methods, Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has gained prominence due to its capability to yield interpretable and meaningful low-dimensional representations. However, one significant challenge for NMF is the vast number of solutions for the same problem instance, making the selection of high-quality signatures a complex task. In response to this challenge, our work introduces a novel approach, Self-Matrix Factorization (SMF), which leverages NMF by incorporating constraints that preserve the relationships inherent in the original data. This is achieved by drawing inspiration from a distinct family of matrix decomposition methods, known as Self-Expressive Models (SEM).
In our experimental analyses, conducted on two diverse benchmark datasets, our findings present a compelling narrative. SMF consistently delivers competitive or even superior performance when compared to NMF in predictive tasks. However, what truly sets SMF apart, as validated by our empirical results, is its remarkable ability to consistently generate significantly more meaningful object representations.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper revisits the Nonnegative Matrix Factorization problem, by adding extra constraints inspired by the Self Expressive Models. The authors present some empirical results on different accuracy and qualitative metrics.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and has a good empirical analysis of the chosen datasets.

### Weaknesses
The area of NMF is very well studied, and the truth is that with more modern methods inspired by relational learning, GNNs can do a much better job at the applications in which NMF has been used. The paper has some good intuitions, and the idea of introducing the Self Expressiveness on the W matrix subspace is interesting. However, we don't have any theoretical guarantees that this is going to work in general. I would accept intuition as a guidance, but:
- NMF suffers from local minima, and this needs to be studied extensively, even empirically
- The number of experiments is too small to get some significant guarantees. We need a much bigger pool of benchmarks
- Scalability is another issue not examined. This is strongly tied to runtimes and convergence steps needed

### Questions
Can the authors quantify the robustness to local minima?

### Summary
This paper presents a Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) approach, named Self-Matrix Factorization (SMF), which factorizes association matrix into low dimensional representations. The proposed solution is derived from Self-Expressive Models (SEM). The representations or so-called signatures in the paper are learned by imposing  the reconstruction to use only data points that lie in the same low dimensional subspace. This way can guarantee the solutions are within some confined space. In addition, the paper states that the proposed method is robust and also can capture meaningful relationships. Experimental results showed that the proposed SMF product comparable or better prediction results than other existing NMF or SEM methods.

### Strengths
1. The paper is easy to read and understand. The concept of proposed solution is simple. 
2. The low dimensional representations are meaningful and the intra-class distance of the factorization is larger compared to results from other methods.
3. Results are produced by real world datasets, and the precision-recall curve is comparable to other methods.

### Weaknesses
1. It is somewhat incremental improvement from SEM. The results are comparable, not significantly better. 
2. How to interpret the meaningful relationships in the low dimensional representations need more elaboration.

### Questions
1. Some metrics are not well explained in the paper. What is the formula to compute Z-score? 
2. Are the low dimensional data representations stable? How would it change if small amount of data are added or deleted from association matrix?  
3. In figure 2, Precision at top-K decreases in the proposed method, especially for movielens dataset. Is there any explanation?

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This paper proposed a combination model from NMF and SEM to conduct signature learning, and validated its effectiveness through two experiments w.r.t. matrix completion and link prediction tasks.

Overall, this work looks solid but with very limited novelty.

### Strengths
The writting logic is good.

### Weaknesses
1. the proposed SMF could be viewed as a combination of NMF and SEM, so its novelty is limited.
2. some mathematical symbols are not clearly stated, such as A and X in section 4.1, and \alpha in section 4.2.
3. the selected competitive baselines can be more richful, such as spareNMF [1], GraphNMF [2].

### Questions
I have no questions.
