## Abstract
Dataset distillation aims to optimize a small set so that a model trained on the set achieves performance similar to that of a model trained on the full dataset. While many supervised methods have achieved remarkable success in distilling a large dataset into a small set of representative samples, however, 
they are not designed to produce a distilled dataset that can be effectively used to facilitate self-supervised pre-training. To this end, we propose a novel problem of distilling an unlabeled dataset into a set of small synthetic samples for efficient self-supervised learning (SSL). We first prove that a gradient of synthetic samples with respect to a SSL objective in naive bilevel optimization is \textit{biased} due to the randomness originating from data augmentations or masking for inner optimization. To address this issue, we propose to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between a model's representations of the synthetic examples and their corresponding learnable target feature representations for the inner objective, which does not introduce any randomness. Our primary motivation is that the model obtained by the proposed inner optimization can mimic the \textit{self-supervised target model}. To achieve this, we also introduce the MSE between representations of the inner model and the self-supervised target model on the original full dataset for outer optimization. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our method on transfer learning

### Summary
Dataset distillation is an important and interesting direction in dealing with data-redundancy settings. 
Most dataset distillation methods focus on dataset-specific tasks, overlooking the transfer ability of condensed datasets.   This paper tried to address the transfer ability in the unlabeled setting, via self-supervised in a bi-level optimization framework. The distillation experiments verified the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. Interesting and novel problem setting:  self-supervised dataset distillation for transfer learning, which might produce task-agnostic condensed data and boost transferability.
2. Theorem contribution: a gradient of the SSL objectives with data augmentations or masking inputs is a biased estimator of the true gradient. And provide detailed proof.
3. Interesting experiments that outperform the supervised distillation method with self-supervised learning.

### Weaknesses
1. What is the motivation for minimizing MSE between the original data representation of the model from inner loop and that of the model pre-trained on the original dataset? It's unclear why aligning the feature space of the distilled dataset with the pre-trained model's feature space is the right approach for transfer learning. The paper needs to provide a more rigorous justification for this design choice, perhaps by relating it to established theories of transferability or generalization.

2. Why self-supervised learning method is better than the supervised method in this problem? I only see the empirical results, could you provide more explanation? The paper should delve deeper into the underlying reasons for the observed performance differences. For instance, does the self-supervised objective inherently lead to more robust or generalizable features in the context of dataset distillation? A theoretical or more in-depth analysis would strengthen this claim.

### Summary
This paper targets at a new problem branched from conventional dataset distillation (DD) ------- unsupervised DD, which aims to synthesize an informative small dataset that can be used for facilitating self-supervised pre-training. The experimental results show the potential of the proposed method in the application of transfer learning, architecture generalization and data-free knowledge distillation.

### Strengths
1) The problem that this paper focused on is somewhat new to the dataset distillation community;
2) The presentation and writing of this paper is coherent, the idea is easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1) This paper dose NOT choose the state-of-the-art baselines in dataset distillation for comparison, such as IDC, IDM, etc.
2) The authors only provide the experimental results of transfer learning, but did NOT provide the test accuracy of the model trained barely on the distilled dataset. This makes me wondering if the distilled images can keep enough information compared to the images distilled by other baselines, or is the proposed method only performs well in the scenario of transfer learning ?

### Summary
The paper considers dataset distillation, which aims at learning a small number of representative examples for a large data set. Unlike previous supervised methods, the authors target a self-supervised learning setup. To counter issues with naive bi-level optimization, they adapt the training loss to an MSE-based objective more akin to feature distillation. This allows for further simplifications such as casting one of the subproblems as kernel ridge regression. The method is evaluated in a transfer learning setting where the goal is to use the distilled data set to train a variety of networks which are then transferred to different data sets. A broad range of source data sets, target data sets and network architectures is considered.

### Strengths
The paper is overall well written and easy to follow. The method is relatively well-motivated, with the scenario when one wants to train many different architectures to find the best one for mobile/resource constrained deployment. The experiments cover a broad range of source, and transfer data sets, and many different network architectures are considered. The method is novel as far as I can tell (although I’m not an expert on dataset distillation).

### Weaknesses
Despite the overall positive impression, I see several weaknesses:
- In the experiments the authors distill the data sets into 1000-2000 examples, for self-supervised learning, without augmentation. The authors do not comment on augmentations when training on the distilled data. This approach might work for the small models and low resolution used in the experiments, but I’m not convinced that it generalizes to larger models, more complex data sets and higher resolution. Data augmentation is a central component in many SSL methods including Barlow Twins, which the authors use.
- Unrelated to data augmentation, I feel it would be necessary to run the algorithm on a less small-scale setup, e.g. on 224x224 ImageNet, and on larger downstream models (ResNet18 or similar) to make a convincing case, in particular given the complexity of the algorithm. I know this requires some compute, but one such experiment would still be necessary in my opinion.
- Some baselines might be weak; for example MobileNet and ResNet10 from scratch get < 4% accuracy on Cars.

Minor comments:
- The abstract might be hard to follow for readers unfamiliar with prior works on dataset distillation.

### Questions
- For the kmeans clustering baseline, what does “kmeans-clustering in feature space of the source dataset” mean? What feature space is used?
- Is the Barlow-Twin target model trained with augmentation?

### Summary
The authors introduce a novel problem within the domain of dataset distillation, focusing on the distillation of an unlabeled dataset into a compact set of small synthetic samples tailored for optimizing self-supervised learning (SSL) efficiency.
In this work, the authors address a significant challenge related to the bias introduced during the calculation of gradients for synthetic samples with respect to SSL objectives. This bias originates from the inherent randomness associated with data augmentation and masking techniques. To mitigate this issue, they present an innovative strategy. This approach centers on minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between a model's representations of synthetic examples and the corresponding learnable target feature representations, effectively removing the randomness from the gradient computation.
In terms of computational efficiency, the authors propose a streamlined methodology that leverages a fixed feature extractor. They focus their optimization efforts on a linear head atop this stable feature extractor, resulting in substantial reductions in computational overhead. Importantly, this linear head optimization is thoughtfully formulated to yield a closed-form solution, employing kernel ridge regression for practical implementation.
The practical utility and impact of the proposed method are rigorously validated through empirical assessments spanning various applications, particularly those involving transfer learning. The experimental results are promising and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solution.

### Strengths
1. The authors introduce a novel problem within the context of dataset distillation, addressing the challenge of distilling an unlabeled dataset into synthetic samples optimized explicitly for self-supervised learning (SSL). As far as I know, this is the first work in this direction.

2.  The authors identify and effectively tackle a significant bias issue that arises during gradient calculations for synthetic samples. By introducing a methodology that minimizes mean squared error (MSE) between model representations and target feature representations, they successfully eliminate randomness in gradient computations, enhancing the reliability of their approach.

3. A notable strength lies in the authors' approach to computational efficiency. By assuming a fixed feature extractor and optimizing a linear head on top of it, they substantially reduce the computational burden. Furthermore, their formulation allows for a closed-form solution using kernel ridge regression, streamlining the implementation.

4 The writing is clear and well-organized, making it easy for readers to understand the problem, approach, and results. The authors provide a structured narrative that guides the reader through their research.

### Weaknesses
 1. Clarity Issue: The concept of "target representation" requires further elucidation for clarity and better understanding.

 2. Theoretical Analysis of Instability: It is good to conduct a theoretical analysis of the instability inherent in the bilevel formulation when optimizing a condensed dataset with a self-supervised learning (SSL) objective. My question is, does this instability observed in the bilevel formulation similarly apply to the supervised dataset condensation formulation?

 3. Rationale for Kernel Ridge Regression: The reason for selecting kernel ridge regression as the methodology in this work warrants clarification. Is there a specific rationale behind this choice within the proposed solution? Could alternative matching strategies such as distribution matching or gradient matching also be integrated into the proposed method?

 4. Stability Issues with SSL Data Augmentation: Furthermore, our empirical observations indicate that the process of back-propagating through data augmentations utilized in self-supervised learning (SSL) introduces instability and poses challenges. However, further explanation is needed to fully comprehend why data augmentation in SSL leads to these instabilities.

### Summary
This paper explored a new direction of dataset distillation in the scenario of self-supervised learning, where the target dataset to be compressed were unlabeled. Specifically, the authors first analyzed the problem of naive bi-level formulation with a SSL objective and then proposed to replace it with a MSE loss to mimic the target model. Experiments were conducted to compare the proposed method KRR-ST with other counterparts via transfer learning and results demonstrated the effectiveness of KRR-ST.

### Strengths
- The area of dataset distillation for self-supervised learning is under-explored and this paper made an attempt to compress those datasets without labels and provided important insights on future research.
- Rigorous analysis about the biased gradient estimator of the inner optimization with a SSL objective was presented in the paper, and it motivated the proposed MSE loss in KRR-ST without impact of data augmentation.
- Comprehensive experiments were conducted covering three different datasets (CIFAR100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet) to showcase the advantages of KRR-ST for distillation in self-supervised learning settings.

### Weaknesses
 - In Equation (2), both $X_s$ and $Y_s$ were trainable parameters and $\theta$ was minimized in the inner optimization. The process looked a little weird to me although I understand that this design was to make inner and outer optimization consistent. More detailed analysis of $Y_s$ can be provided. For example, we know that $X_s$ was initialized with real images, then how about $Y_s$? Would initialization have great impact on the final performance?
- An important comparison with the model pre-trained on the whole dataset was missing. These results should be included to indicate how far current dataset distillation methods were from the "oracle" model and to evaluate the practicality of KRR-ST in real world applications.
- From the visualization, it seemed that the distilled images were not very different from original ones and looked exactly the same. Is it possible to report other metrics to measure the difference between synthetic examples and real ones apart from visualization?
- It was not clear how dataset distillation methods such as DSA and DM were adapted to the self-supervised settings and it was a non-trivial process.
