# Is Memorization Actually Necessary for Generalization?

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 3, 3, 3

## Abstract
Memorization is the ability of deep models to associate training data with seemingly random labels. Even though memorization may not align with models’ ability to generalize, recent work by Feldman and Zhang (2020) has demonstrated that memorization is in fact necessary for generalization. However, upon closer inspection of this work, we uncover several methodological errors including lack of model convergence, data leakage, and sub- population shift. We show that these errors led to a significant overestimation of memorization’s impact on test accuracy (by over five times). After accounting for these errors, we demonstrate that memorization does not impact prediction accuracy as previously reported, and therefore, it is not necessary for generalization. In light of these findings, future researchers are encouraged to design better techniques to identify memorized points that can avoid some of the earlier stated problems.

### Summary
_Note: the paper seems to be using a different font (font weight? I'm not sure) than the one provided in the conference style file, but this font seems extremely close and to just take slightly more space, so I doubt the authors are using it to "cheat". Also it's maybe just my PDF reader having a moment._

This paper is very much a follow up of [1], and points out 3 methodological mistakes done by the original study.
- The lack of weight decay
- Near-duplicates found in both train and test
- Sub-population removals due to the way points were counted as memorized

By correcting for these, the authors show that the effect measured by [1], while still present, is much more marginal.

### Strengths
This is good science, the paper doesn't go into a lot of depth other than the experiments it does and the reasoning for them, but it paints a complete picture, and rectifies past work.

### Weaknesses
This is in some sense very minimal a contribution. It's not quite a negative result because it seems like the effect, while lessened, still exists. There's also no novel algorithmic contribution, e.g. finding better measures of memorization is left to future work. Most of the methodology stems from prior work (other than the corrected mistakes of course).

Because of this, I feel like I don't have much to say in this review. This is good work but also really just above what I'd consider sufficient for a conference paper.

### Questions
- "and therefore, [memorization] is not necessary for generalization." I'm curious why the authors claim this if the effect still exists. Is it not statistically significant away from being 0? I would rephrase the abstract to be a bit more conservative.
- I didn't find in [1] nor in this paper how training accounts for the removal of data, i.e., in Table 2, are all models trained on the same number of points? Doing otherwise would seem... incorrect?
- I understand the immense computational costs here, but [1] runs these experiments on 3 datasets (MNIST, CIFAR100, & ImageNet). How do we know if these results are generalizable? (A cheap way would be to confirm this on synthetic data with artificial problems like subpopulations).

### Summary
<This paper does not follow the ICLR format>

The paper in question conducts a thorough examination of the claims made by Feldman and Zhang regarding the necessity of memorization for optimal generalization. The authors of the reviewed work identify three core issues that they believe led to overstated results in the original study: lack of model convergence, data leakage, and subpopulation shift. They address these issues by implementing weight decay for better model convergence, removing near-duplicates from datasets, and conducting a subpopulation analysis to preserve unique subpopulation examples. Their findings suggest that by addressing these factors, the impact of memorization on accuracy is significantly less than previously reported, reducing the loss in accuracy due to memorization by a factor of five.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-structured, offering a clear foundational context for the issues tackled.
2. Figures accompanying the explanations provide clarity and enhance understanding of the exact problem that the authors identify in the previous work.
3. The results challenge the widespread belief about memorization's role in generalization and show a surprising reduction in accuracy loss, suggesting that previous results were indeed overstated.
4. I particularly  like the results on model convergence and data leakage where it is sensible to remove near duplicates.

### Weaknesses
 <This paper is not following the ICLR format>

1. The critique regarding subpopulation shifts questions the validity of ignoring the central hypothesis of Feldman and Zhang's work, which emphasized the importance of memorizing near-singleton subpopulations. In particular, when you put examples from small subpopulations back into the original training set in order to allow for the test set examples from the same subpopulation to perform well, that defeats the entire purpose of the original paper where they claim that because some test set subpopulations have only one or two members in the training set, therefore they need to be memorized to perform well. So the results on the subpopulation shift are unfounded in my opinion, but I do agree with the results on model convergence and data leakage particularly, but I do not think that the effect is as prominent as the original claim of the paper. 
2. The paper fails to replicate a key analysis from Feldman and Zhang's work, specifically the varied levels of model accuracy against memorization thresholds, limiting the robustness of the current findings.  I think that this work needs to do a proper analysis to replicate figure 2 of the paper by Feldman and Zhang where they have various levels of model accuracy with respect to memorization value threshold on ImageNet CIFAR-100 and MNIST datasets, and they show that removing random examples is better than removing memorized examples. In my opinion, this is a critical figure and a critical analysis that the authors need to present, whereas at this point, the authors have only presented results at one single point, which does not account for a solid justification that a prior method does not succeed.
3. There is a concern about the fair comparison due to the reduction of examples used in the training set without adequately accounting for this change in the experimental setup. (See Questions)

### Questions
1. Would the accuracy loss remain lower if an additional 516 random data points replaced the omitted 499 examples, keeping the training set size constant?

2. Can the authors replicate the original paper's results across different memorization thresholds, particularly on the CIFAR-100 dataset, and possibly on other datasets as well? This would provide a more comprehensive view of the memorization effects at varying levels.

### Summary
This paper investigates the relationship between memorization and generalization in machine learning models. Previous works have conducted empirical studies based on theoretical foundations, demonstrating that memorization is necessary for achieving better generalization on long-tail distributions. However, in this paper, the authors argue that there are flaws in the methodology of these previous studies, which led them to question the necessity of memorization. Therefore, the authors identify these issues and propose potential fixes, ultimately suggesting that memorization may not be necessary for the model to generalize, thereby challenging the previous findings.

### Strengths
Despite there being ample room for further improvement of the paper, there are interesting visualizations of memorized and sub-population shifts in the paper.

### Weaknesses
In general, the presented study appears to be inadequately explored, leaving more room for further empirical research and justification of observations based on theoretical foundations. The stated issues do not necessarily contradict the findings of the previous work, especially in the case of the "Sub-population Shift" argument, which I will explain further in my review. Therefore, this paper may not be suitable for this particular venue and might be better suited as a workshop paper or considered for the reproducibility track to facilitate further experimentation and validation of the results.

I am strongly leaning towards rejecting the paper; however, I will try to provide my understanding, concerns, and suggestions for the authors so they can reevaluate their work and make a better presentation of their study.

Concerns, understanding, and suggestions:
1. The introduction section does not adequately define the problem, and the background section has not provided sufficient background information.
2. Regarding errors stated in the paper:
    1. “Lack of Convergence: Models”: Why should models be trained to their maximum test set accuracy? You don't have access to the test set during training!
    2. “Data Leakage: Training”: The authors of the original work stated this in their paper in Figure 3 that there is a close match of memorized points in the test set.
    3. "Sub-population Shift": The argument does not necessarily contradict the previous work because it aligns with what they have been arguing in their paper: memorization is necessary due to the long-tail distribution. Both mislabeled and sub-population data points are part of the long tail; therefore. It does not necessarily mean that the model memorized the points associated with sub-populations. They have high influence scores because they are rare in the data distribution, and the model exhibits a similar behavior of memorization.
3. There is an argument in the paper that the definition of memorization from the original work is incorrect, but there is no strong justification for this claim, and it is deferred to future research. I would suggest the authors first review their observations and results and then use them to formulate a more robust definition of memorization. In that case, your work would be better supported.
4. There are many repetitions of information with different formats conveying the same content in the paper, such as in the Introduction, Background, Related work, Discussion, and Conclusion. The presentation format could be significantly improved.
5. The "Data Leakage" in the Background section is not sufficiently well explained. I have read the "Do CIFAR-10 classifiers generalize to CIFAR-10?" paper, and the context provided in your paper is what they have already explained, and it can be moved to the appendix.
6. Table 1: It is not necessary to provide a table for symbols in the main pages; it can be moved to the appendix.
7. A large portion of the paper is dedicated to understanding the original paper, and it is defined in a way that favors the introduced issues mentioned at the beginning of your paper. It can be shortened, and the detailed discussion can be left in the appendix.
8. Section 5.1 (SETUP): You should check what your models memorize with the modifications you have made, not just the 1015 memorized points provided by the original authors.
9. The implementation of fixes is not provided along with the submission.

### Questions
Questions: 
1. The previous work that you studied is based on a theoretical background. Could you please delve into the details of the theory part and justify your observation? I believe that if your argument is completely true, it should also be possible to find a flaw in the theory of the work.
2. Section 5.1 (SETUP): How did you define which points impact the same test point?
3. Section 4.2 (ERROR: DATASET LEAKAGE): Are you assuming that duplicate points are only found in memorized points?

### Summary
This paper challenges the previous finding that memorization is necessary for generalization. They study the same setting as in Feldman and Zhang (2020), except (i) the models are trained to convergence, (ii) data points appearing both in the train and test set are handled properly, and (iii) memorized points that belong to sub-populations are preserved. The results indicate that most of the accuracy drop reported by Feldman and Zhang (2020) can be recovered by the above-mentioned measure.

### Strengths
This work touches upon an interesting observation and shows how fragile/unreliably the findings of Feldman and Zhang (2020). Other than this, I do not see any strength in this work.

### Weaknesses
- I feel fix-1 changes the entire story. First, "lack of model convergence" sounds like gradient descent hasn't converged, which is slightly misleading. Second and more importantly, it is natural to expect that changing the optimization objective or including different regularization techniques, architectures, etc would impact the findings. After all, the previous work focuses on one particular setup, which would of course make their findings difficult to transfer to new setups.
- Because the setup has changed in certain ways, one may expect different train points to be memorized. Hence, the change in the accuracy should be computed after the points memorized *in this setup* are removed (not the ones reported in the reference paper).
- The analysis is only done for one dataset while the reference paper considers three datasets, which restricts the generality of the findings in this paper.
- More than half of the original memorized points are included in the new training set. In other words, the post-pruning training dataset has a bigger size, which would naturally incur a smaller change in accuracy; hence comparing the reported accuracy change (0.54) against the original number (2.54) would not be fair.

### Questions
- _Entire sub-populations were removed alongside the memorized points._ <-- What is a sub-population?
- _original paper reported a drop of $2.54 \pm 0.20%$. However, we can see that after training the models to convergence, the value halved to $1.78 \pm 0.32%$._ <-- Does the number really halved?
- _We can see in the Table that the Leakage+Shift bucket has a three times larger impact on test accuracy than that of the memorized bucket (1.25 vs 0.54)_. <--- Again, is the math correct?
